# StrikLenz — How Data Is Stored & Manipulated

## Storage (MongoDB)

Primary database name comes from `DB_NAME` (env). Key collections:

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `oi_snapshots` | Strike-level OI ticks per index/expiry/timestamp (unique compound index) |
| `index_registry` | Admin-enabled underlyings (bootstrap NIFTY/SENSEX/BANKNIFTY). Disable hides from the desk; snapshots stay |
| `kite_underlyings` | Compact search cache from the daily Kite instruments dump |
| `admin_audit` | Admin enable/disable (and similar) with previous/new state |
| `alerts` | Shared server-side OI reversal / pressure alerts; prior-day records are removed at 09:00 IST |
| `straddle_samples` | ATM straddle time series |
| `market_memory_events` / `market_memory_state` | Level interactions and latest per-index memory state, captured from existing OI snapshots |
| `credentials` | Encrypted Kite API key/secret/token vault (`_id: kite`) |
| `settings` | Admin settings, public access flag (`open`, `require_approval`, expiry), configurable public-entry auth wait (5–60 seconds), password hash, sidebar notes, `mcx_desk_on`, Market Intelligence ingest/retention, `telegram_prefs` (alert filters + Fernet `bot_token_enc` + `chat_id`), `adr_prefs` (Twelve Data Fernet `api_key_enc`, poll/alerts), and landing-page config including the Admin-refreshed sanitized plan-demo snapshot |
| `adr_universe` | Admin-editable Indian ADR list (company, NSE symbol, US ticker, sector, ratio) |
| `adr_observations` | Twelve Data quote snapshots (time series; pruned with snapshot retention, latest kept) |
| `adr_latest` | Last successful observation per ADR (survives a failed poll) |
| `desk_ai_providers` | Vaulted OpenAI-compatible Desk AI keys (`key_enc`); `_id`/`id` plus `_active` pointer |
| `mi_sources` | Admin Market Intelligence sources (RSS/API/Firecrawl); secrets encrypted. The ingest worker also maintains three public, index-specific Google News RSS searches for material events affecting the 12 highest-weight uploaded constituents per index, preserving admin-edited URLs and source enablement. |
| `mi_articles` | Normalized scored news; rolling calendar-day retention. Index exposure and exact-company matches against today's NSE-scheduled quarterly results are calculated on read from these retained clusters, `index_constituents`, and `nse_events`; they are not separately persisted. Missing matches mean no related story was found in the current feed, not that no result was published. |
| `mi_direction_evaluations` | One news-direction / volatility evaluation per `event_cluster_id`, with first-receipt direction strength and catalyst labels, per-index OI snapshot baselines, and observed 15m / 1h / session-close outcomes; 180-day TTL |
| `mi_user_prefs` | Per-user MI page/popup preferences |
| `mi_popup_seen` | Popup ack by `user_id` + `event_cluster_id` |
| `admin_sessions` | Short-lived admin bearer tokens |
| `admin_remember_devices` | 24h IP-bound remember-me tokens |
| `guest_sessions` | Guest tokens, revoke, IP |
| `members` | Google-verified member identity, current plan/subscription pointer, private normalized preferences including hidden dashboard pages, and the immutable first-linked `linked_kite_user_id` for Pro's single-Zerodha-account boundary |
| `member_sessions` | Long-lived member sessions with expiry and revocation state; `_id` is SHA-256 of the bearer token (legacy raw-token rows remain readable for compatibility) |
| `user_kite` | Encrypted caller broker API key, API secret and daily access token; Pro member rows use the stable Google `member_id` (Google subject), not a per-login session. The member name/email remain in `members`, avoiding duplicate profile data in the credential vault. App credentials survive token expiry, broker sign-out, broker rejection, and plan lapses; members can permanently remove the encrypted credential record from the account broker settings, including after access lapses. The first successful Pro token exchange binds `members.linked_kite_user_id`; that identity remains after credential replacement/removal and daily-session expiry, and mismatched account IDs are rejected. Member secrets are never returned to the client; guests continue using the publisher app. No automatic TTL is configured. |
| `member_journal` | Private Pro journal, unique per `(user_id, date)`; month/year/period/day queries are filtered by the authenticated member ID and never read admin `trade_journal` rows. Successful member Positions refreshes save daily booked/open P&L, aggregate counts, and per-index P&L only—never broker position legs or detailed cycles. Member summaries do not include brokerage/charges. Member notes, tags, rating, screenshots, and daily summaries remain stored after a plan lapse; detailed cycles remain controlled separately by the admin opt-in. No automatic TTL or member self-service journal deletion is configured. |
| `member_subscriptions` | Razorpay subscription lifecycle and plan/cadence metadata scoped to `user_id`; pending checkout link and payment state are retained for member recovery and admin audit. No automatic TTL is configured. |
| `billing_events` | Razorpay webhook event records for provider delivery tracking; event IDs, event type, subscription ID, and receipt time only. These deduplicated records back Admin's all-time charges/renewals, cancellations, and failed-payment counts (indexed by event type). No automatic TTL is configured. |
| `member_audit` | Redacted member/admin/provider actions for plan overrides, suspension, consent, checkout, payment-state transitions, and broker-credential/session changes; never stores broker secrets or request tokens. Admins can inspect the audit; a member can read only their own latest 25 subscription events through `/membership/me`, with details allowlisted and redacted. No automatic TTL is configured. |
| `member_alerts` | Small per-member alert acknowledgement records keyed by member and shared alert ID; source alert data is not copied |
| `member_alert_events` | Per-member OI-shift inbox events keyed by a member-scoped digest; the authenticated member ID is the ownership boundary and a TTL index expires events at the daily alert-retention boundary |
| `guest_ip_names` | Last guest display name per IP |
| `access_requests` | Pending/approved/rejected guest entry requests |
| `blocked_ips` | Hard blocks |
| `trade_journal` | Admin trade journal: one document per **session** IST date (`session_anchor_date`, not midnight). Pre-open / weekend writes stay on the last session so Kite’s still-open day P&L cannot clone yesterday onto today. Stores booked P&L from **full exits and partial closes**, `funds_base` (**wallet** = Kite opening cash + collateral + pay-in; never leftover `net`, never SPAN/`utilised`), `booked_pct` of wallet **after charges**, `funds_total` / `funds_close`, inferred `inferred_cashflow` (Kite has no withdrawal API), brokerage/`charges_total`, notes, tags, rating, screenshots. Session-day rows have no TTL or date-based retention. Cleanup is limited to automatic non-session rows and pre-open calendar-date clones; equal P&L on consecutive days is not used to skip or delete a current session-day row. |
| `trade_cycles` | Admin/guest/opted-in Pro broker-book trade cycles, scoped by owner and contract cycle. Admin **Save my trade cycles** controls future admin writes; Pro member persistence is a separate per-account admin opt-in and defaults off. Turning storage off keeps existing records and daily `trade_journal` P&L, and does not affect guest cycle history. The admin Trade Journal can export this admin's closed-cycle documents for an exact inclusive Exit Date range as gzip NDJSON. After explicit confirmation and a matching SHA-256 check over that same range, Compact removes only `events` / `fills`; permanent Delete removes the selected closed cycles. Both actions require downloading the matching archive first. Guest/member cycles, open/partial cycles, and dates outside the range are never touched by admin archive actions. Compact retains summaries and partials; Delete does not. |

Trade-cycle archives are downloaded from the admin Trade Journal as
`striklenz-cycle-archive-YYYY-MM-DD-to-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl.gz`. Each decompressed
line is one Extended JSON Mongo document. Keep the archive outside the
application before confirming either action. The API re-hashes the same
inclusive date range and refuses to compact or delete if it no longer matches
the downloaded archive fingerprint. After compaction, a fresh archive can still
be downloaded with the retained summaries and used to delete those closed
cycles if desired. Deletion rechecks owner, closed status, and dates while
removing verified IDs in bounded batches. Large compact/delete requests may take
up to two minutes from the browser. Previously downloaded monthly archives remain uploadable.
Delete is irreversible from the app; the external archive is the recovery copy.

An admin may also upload a downloaded `.jsonl.gz` archive into the Trade Journal.
The browser decompresses and validates it locally, then displays cycle-ledger
P&L by exit date and the full cycle records in a separate calendar view. It
does not merge with or write to `trade_journal`, and the uploaded records are
held only in browser-tab memory; refreshing or closing the tab clears them.
These imported cycle totals are not the saved daily journal P&L.
Daily session P&L remains in `trade_journal` and is independent of cycle
compaction and deletion.
| `error_logs` | Uncaught API errors, `logger.exception`, and desk UI crashes (`POST /api/errors`). Admin `GET /api/errors`. Tokens redacted. Same fingerprint within 5 minutes increments `count`. |
| `admin_ui_state` | Per-admin UI watermarks (`_id` = admin username). `last_error_log_seen_at` drives the unseen Error Log badge (`GET /api/errors/unseen-count`, `POST /api/errors/mark-seen`). |
| Constituents / events / holidays | Uploaded calendars & index members (`index_constituents`, `nse_events`, `nse_holidays`) — see [UPLOAD.md](./UPLOAD.md) for CSV columns and replace rules |

Retention: OI / straddle samples default to **96 hours** so Friday’s session survives the weekend and Monday pre-open (`SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_HOURS` / `STRADDLE_RETENTION_HOURS`). Prune also floors at the previous trading day’s open. Weekend / holiday / pre-open APIs resolve `session_anchor_date` (last trading day) for history, straddle, and banners. After configured market close, OI polling stops; **GIFT Nifty** continues on its own schedule.

Member journal entries, billing records, and audit events currently have no
automatic expiry. A subscription lapse, refund, cancellation, or admin
suspension changes feature access but does not delete a member's journal,
broker configuration, or other private records. A member can remove their own
encrypted broker credential record at any time; that action also clears the
daily session token. Pro trade-cycle persistence is off unless explicitly
enabled by an admin. Turning it off stops future saved cycles but does not
delete prior cycles. The application does not currently provide member account
or journal deletion/export controls; data removal beyond broker credentials
requires an operator-managed database action. Backups follow the hosting
provider's configured retention, which is separate from application cleanup.

Shared OI alert records and member acknowledgement rows are removed at the
09:00 IST wall-clock boundary. Member alert reads filter the shared alert
source by the member's selected indices, alert type, and minimum OI-change
threshold; they do not fan out full market snapshots or write a duplicate alert
document for each member. Trade-cycle saving for Pro is off until the admin
explicitly opts in for that account.

Market Intel outcome measurement reads the already-persisted `oi_snapshots`
collection only; it does not request quotes or change poll timing. A direction
event is benchmarked using the latest snapshot at or before first app receipt,
no more than five minutes old. Each NIFTY / SENSEX / BANKNIFTY target price must
be within five minutes of 15 minutes, one hour, or the session poll-close.
Missing baselines and target snapshots remain unavailable rather than being
filled or interpolated. Flat moves under 0.05% do not count as correct or
incorrect. The separate `mi_direction_evaluations` collection retains these
measurements for 180 days, independent of the shorter article-feed retention.
After-hours and pre-open stories are excluded from same-session scoring.
Volatility outcomes are stored independently in the same evaluation document:
India VIX change uses the NIFTY snapshot stream, while each index's realized
high-low range after the story is compared with an equally long preceding
window. A VIX increase is material only when both +0.5 points and +5% are met;
a wider index range needs both +0.05 percentage points and 20% expansion.
Each range window needs at least three snapshots and quotes within five
minutes of both edges. Incomplete windows remain unavailable. These outcome
reads do not fetch data or alter the OI poll.

Market Intel also has a dedicated India-linked global-company RSS search.
During ingestion, material developments that name a company in the uploaded
`index_constituents` data receive an India-relevance and impact boost, so they
can pass the normal feed storage threshold. This uses the configured constituent
names/symbols; keep those uploads current for reliable company matching.

Similar headlines are assigned the same `event_cluster_id` during ingestion;
the evaluation collection's unique index and upsert key ensure that multiple
publishers do not create extra outcome samples for one event. Direction
strength is the absolute magnitude of the existing signed heuristic score,
bucketed as weak (1–24), moderate (25–49), or strong (50–100); it is not a
probability. Strong-vs-weak direction hit-rate comparisons and volatility
breakdowns by RBI, crude, global rates, and earnings are shown only after 30
usable event outcomes in the relevant group. These new breakdowns apply to
evaluations recorded with the new fields; old records are not reclassified or
backfilled.

## Instrument universe

Tracked names live in `backend/universe.py` and `frontend/src/lib/universe.js`. Default poller ids are **NIFTY / SENSEX / BANKNIFTY**. MCX majors **CRUDEOIL, GOLD, SILVER, NATURALGAS** are pollable (ATM = nearest FUT, hours 09:00–23:30 IST) once Admin enables them in Index management. They are not on by default. `/api/config` includes `universe`. See [ADR-001](./decisions/ADR-001-instrument-universe.md) and [ADR-003](./decisions/ADR-003-mcx-majors.md).

## Live pipeline

```
Kite Connect ──► OITracker (asyncio poll) ──► oi_snapshots
                      │
                      ├── last_snapshot[index] (in-memory hot cache)
                      ├── alert engine → alerts + Telegram
                      └── /oi/{index}/change reads current vs older snapshot
```

1. **Poll** — While the market is in session (regular hours or Muhurat / special session, or `FORCE_ALWAYS_POLL`), tracker fetches option chain for each **enabled** index and selected expiry. Kite Connect does not expose a holiday/session-open endpoint; hours come from the NSE calendar plus a live quote last_trade_time check.
2. **Normalize** — Snapshot includes spot, ATM, PCR, per-strike CE/PE OI, VIX when available, `timestamp` / `created_at`.
3. **Upsert** — Written to `oi_snapshots` with uniqueness on `(index, expiry, timestamp)`.
4. **On demand** — Boot fetches OI for the **open index** only; other chips load when selected. FII/DII and impact fetch when that tile is opened. The Header and Positions page share one `/positions` poll during the cash session; Admin config controls its interval (1–3600 seconds, default 2). The interval is measured between request starts, not added after each response; in-flight requests are never duplicated. Index management **Search/Sync** loads the Kite name list — login and `/expiries` do not dump `kite.instruments()`. Auth 520/timeout does not sign you out.
   Dashboard info-tile dropdowns are mutually exclusive within each responsive row: opening Holiday, FII/DII, Events, or Index Impact closes the previously opened tile.
   Settings reads omit retired dashboard page and underlying IDs from page ticks, enabled/alert/straddle index lists, weekday defaults, and lot-size maps. Writes drop retired IDs when valid selections remain, but reject selection lists that contain no current required pages or indices.
   Admin configuration has separate saves for shared desk settings and browser-local signal thresholds. Each action reports its own changed-setting count and successful timestamp; a failed save stays visible inline without clearing either form. The save bar remains in view while configuration content scrolls, and the phone layout stacks full-width save controls below the form. Lot sizes can be saved to the browser independently and are also included with a desk save to keep the shared lot-size configuration synchronized.

### Market Memory

Market Memory consumes the existing successful OI snapshot stream; it does not
make a second Kite/provider quote request. The OI Change card refreshes its
summary every 30 seconds while mounted and retains the last successful result
if a read fails. Summary relevance is weighted over the existing 20-day context
window, while the freshness label reflects the latest stored snapshot. The
administrator can show or hide the card for all users in Admin configuration →
Data collection. These display/read changes do not affect the OI polling cadence.

### Change windows

`/oi/{index}/change?minutes=N&also=1,3,5` compares the latest snapshot to the snapshot **at or before now−N** (today’s session open is the floor). The window slides every poll. There is no wait to accumulate N minutes after a restart.

### Fresh Pull (`POST /admin/refresh-day`)

Admin-only reset of the **OI board** (not Upload / constituents / events):

1. `delete_many({})` on `oi_snapshots` (full wipe — avoids leftover prior-day history).
2. Clear in-memory `last_snapshot`.
3. Resolve `enabled_indices` from settings.
4. **Kite mode:** parallel live `get_snapshot` per enabled index → store.
5. **Offline:** no fake backfill; DB stays empty until credentials/live data exist.
6. Refresh extra tickers (VIX / GIFT).

Refused on weekends/holidays so Friday’s last session is not wiped. Use when today’s chain looks contaminated or you need a clean live tick for every enabled index — not for routine polling (the tracker already polls while NSE is open).

## Frontend manipulation

| Concern | Where | Behavior |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Active index / expiry | `Dashboard.jsx` | Drives chart + table; cache hydrated in `oiCacheRef` |
| GEX snapshot | `Dashboard.jsx` + `sellCandidates.js` | Calculates at the OI snapshot time, using valid option legs within a fixed ±3% spot band and the configured contract lot size to avoid far-wing quote noise and stale multipliers. The displayed estimate can still change when the live snapshot changes. If that expiry has elapsed, it may show the prior valid snapshot from the same IST session and labels it as retained; it never carries an expiry fallback across sessions. |
| Timeframe pills | Client | Re-request change window; does not re-fetch Kite |
| Strike filter | Sidebar min/max or ATM ± N | `atmWindow` in `strikeRange.js`: ±N recenters on live ATM as spot moves; `"all"` is the full chain. Manual min/max stops follow until a ±N chip is picked. |
| Compact mode | `localStorage.compact` | Default **on** for viewports ≤1280px (more chart, less chrome) |
| Right panel | Hidden on ≤768px | Phones use full-width chart + Alerts tab/FAB |
| Replay | `/history` + scrubber | Optional `jumpToTs` seeks closest snapshot (huge-shift bookmark in `localStorage`) |
| Stale chip | Sidebar | Inactive index with last OI **>120s** old → amber flash |

CSV download builds from the current/previous client snapshots — no extra server round-trip beyond what’s already loaded.

### Position option-symbol parsing

`GET /positions` enriches option rows by parsing the broker `tradingsymbol` into
underlying, strike, side, and expiry. Compact BSE weekly month codes include
`0`/`O` for October, `N` for November, and `D` for December. The Positions risk
columns and OI chart's position badges depend on these parsed fields; if a new
broker symbol format is not recognized, raw broker P&L may still appear while
those derived fields and expiry-matched badges are omitted.

---

## Modes

- **`kite`** — Real broker data; requires vaulted (or env) API key + daily access token.
- **`offline`** — No live Kite; UI may show last stored / historical day; Fresh Pull will not invent OI.

Dev-only mock simulator loads only when `ENABLE_DEV_MOCK=true` (never used for Fresh Pull backfill in production paths).

---

## Auth data flow

- Admin login → insert `admin_sessions` → frontend stores token in `sessionStorage` → axios sends `X-Admin-Token`.
- Remember me → `admin_remember_devices` bound to IP → auto `/auth/remember-login`.
- Guest → access request → admin approve → `guest_sessions` → `X-Guest-Token`; Public OFF revokes guests.
