Rules of the product:

- Publisher Kite token owns **OI / charts**. Guest books use **their own** Kite login.
- Admin daily P&L journal is **admin-only**; Pro also has a separate private member journal.
- Admin configuration → **Public / Admin dashboard pages**: two ticks per page (guests vs admin desk).
- Ranked sell candidates and conditional sell-side guidance are Admin-only; never expose them to guests or paid members. Keep shared alerts and customer Desk AI market-only.
- After a finished change: bump version per `docs/VERSIONING.md`, open a PR, **merge to main**. Always. Checklist: [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#ship--merge-to-main). New index/stock: [add-an-underlying checklist](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#add-an-underlying) (hours, poll, Positions, journal Others, phone chrome). New UI: same PR on phone; do not grow header/sidebar.
- Protected live-data rule: without explicit administrator approval for that exact
  change, do not modify Positions, OI Change, Open Interest, strike/expiry math,
  Straddle, CAS signals, snapshot freshness/order, broker-book mapping, or poll
  semantics. UI polish and safe admin configuration changes remain allowed.
- Every code change must follow [docs/CHANGE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/CHANGE_CHECKLIST.md),
  including meaningful comments for major/non-obvious frontend and backend
  behavior, updates to stale comments, focused tests, documentation, and
  lockstep versioning.
- Passwordless admin is permitted only for loopback requests in local
  development when explicitly enabled; follow
  [docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_AUTH.md](docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_AUTH.md) and never
  enable it in staging or production.
- For an explicit full/local end-to-end audit request, follow
  [docs/END_TO_END_AUDIT.md](docs/END_TO_END_AUDIT.md): read-only, isolated local
  data, preserve the worktree, and create a sanitized dated report.
