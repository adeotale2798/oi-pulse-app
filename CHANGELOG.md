# Changelog

## V20.62 — 2026-10-18

Compare the NSE calendar’s scheduled constituent results against matched
Market Intel stories. Show per-company result-news found, company-news-only, or
no-match status, and warn when the NSE calendar is stale or unavailable.

## V20.61 — 2026-10-18

Add index-specific public Google News searches for the 12 highest-weight
uploaded constituents per index, targeting results and material company
events over the last 48 hours; surface the publication date on the lead story.

## V20.60 — 2026-10-18

Simplify the Market Intel decision view: show each index's risk, tentative
direction, and main headline first, with supporting evidence and technical
details collapsed until requested.

## V20.59 — 2026-10-18

Connect same-day Market Intel stories to NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, and SENSEX exposure
using constituent weights; show source-backed daily risk summaries in Market
Intel and Index Risk, and include index exposure in existing news alerts.

## V20.58 — 2026-10-17

Make the Admin Tech Stack view easier to understand with a plain-language
architecture overview, a data-flow sketch, and descriptions of each layer.

## V20.57 — 2026-10-17

Add an Admin API Config & Stack dialog with tile navigation between the existing
API Configuration view and an in-app technology stack overview.

## V20.56 — 2026-10-17

Use provider-neutral broker wording across the user interface, public API
messages, and stack inventory while preserving the existing broker integration.

## V20.55 — 2026-10-17

Document the verified application stack, dependency versions, integrations,
runtime requirements, and deployment tooling in `STACK.md`.

## V20.54 — 2026-10-17

Fix phone layouts for the Positions warning threshold and Admin Broker & Payments
settings; open Admin Settings on the current site instead of a hard-coded new tab.

## V20.53 — 2026-10-17

Anchor the automatic monthly NSE event refresh to the last actual manual
upload or successful automatic fetch; confirming existing rows no longer
postpones the next scheduled refresh.

## V20.52 — 2026-10-17

Color Index Risk chips, cards, and weight-sensitive summary tiles consistently
by constituent index share: >5%, 3–5%, 1–3%, <1%, or unavailable. Keep a
stronger rose accent only for >5% events occurring within seven days.

## V20.51 — 2026-10-17

Bring back soft category color to Index Risk summary cards and event cards so
the dashboard is easier to scan without returning to saturated fills.

## V20.50 — 2026-10-17

Restore the previous muted colors for dashboard info tiles and page navigation
after the dark-label pass.

## V20.49 — 2026-10-17

Use high-contrast dark labels for dashboard info tiles and page navigation.
Remove the duplicate upload-source status panel from Index Risk; upload dates
and source details remain available in the Admin upload dialog.

## V20.48 — 2026-10-17

Clarify that event weight bands describe index share rather than predicted
impact, add upcoming-event filters, and show Admins the last successful NSE
calendar update. Keep manual CSV/XLSX upload prominent and available after an
NSE fetch failure.

## V20.47 — 2026-10-17

Add an Admin button to fetch and safely replace the NSE event calendar on
demand. Calm the Index Risk palette by using neutral tiles with muted severity
accents instead of saturated event-chip fills.

## V20.46 — 2026-10-17

Refresh the NSE Equity event calendar from the same three-month CSV export as
the page's Download button at most monthly. Validate the download before
replacing stored rows; retain the manual Admin upload as a fallback and keep
the last good calendar on fetch or validation failure.

## V20.45 — 2026-10-17

Pair event timing with index-weight bands in Index Risk event chips and cards;
clarify that the labels are descriptive context, not a calculated trading risk.

## V20.44 — 2026-10-17

Load the Index Impact tile as soon as the selected index changes, with
distinguishable loading and unavailable states.

## V20.43 — 2026-10-17

Keep Index Risk event-join coverage diagnostics visible only to Admin and omit
that diagnostic payload for other dashboard users.

## V20.42 — 2026-10-16

Parse small constituent weightages as percentage points across NIFTY,
BANKNIFTY, and SENSEX so values such as 0.98 remain 0.98%, not 98%.

## V20.41 — 2026-10-16

Show the uploaded SENSEX constituent name in the 7-day event chips. Let Admin
confirm and continue using any of the five existing upload categories
independently, without changing stored rows; keep freshness advisories
admin-only.

## V20.40 — 2026-10-15

Keep browser autofill fields on the dark Admin login theme. Hide the hidden-page
restore control when no pages are hidden and portal its menu above dashboard
layers without letting the trigger cover dialogs.

## V20.39 — 2026-10-15

Start the Market Intel popup at the bottom-right on each app load while keeping
its in-session docking controls. Improve Positions table-header contrast and
make the ATM-distance percentage easier to read.

## V20.38 — 2026-10-16

Keep the hidden-dashboard-pages dropdown above nearby dashboard content on
desktop and mobile.

## V20.37 — 2026-10-15

Make Admin subscription health actionable with member-level lists for accounts
blocked by disabled Basic access and payment states needing attention. Add a
caller-scoped, redacted subscription history to Account settings with a direct
path to subscribe again. Extend lifecycle/privacy tests; member-owned data
remains intact when paid access ends.

## V20.36 — 2026-10-15

End paid access immediately after cancellation or a failed/ended provider
subscription and return the member to Basic. Add an Admin subscription health
overview with current accessible member counts, all-time charges/renewals,
cancellations, failed payments, and Basic members blocked by plan availability.

## V20.35 — 2026-10-14

Use one persisted Site Walkthrough setting from both Admin controls and hide
public demo entry points when it is disabled. Present the internal Normal
membership tier as Basic and direct members whose plan is disabled to account
and available subscription options without removing their account access.

## V20.34 — 2026-10-14

Open the landing terminal walkthrough with Straddle, Strike Pressure, and
Trade Journal. Restyle the Strike Pressure sample with a centered, percentage
bar that matches the dashboard's session-bias presentation; its inputs remain
fictional preview snapshots.

## V20.33 — 2026-10-14

Prevent the landing hero from clipping the floating dashboard previews'
shadows. Preserve horizontal overflow control and add enough bottom clearance
before the live ticker so the hero and following section feel continuous.

## V20.32 — 2026-10-14

Show the landing sample expiry as 28 Sep with Monthly on the next line. Replace
the hero index list with “Live options intelligence,” present Desk AI as a
consolidated briefing across Market Intel, Global Markets and Indian movers,
and remove the unwanted Premium FAQ sentence. Exact prior default copy is
migrated while custom Admin copy is preserved; landing market ticker continues
to use the shared live feed at the app's 60-second cadence.

## V20.31 — 2026-10-14

Replace the landing hero's index list with “Live options intelligence,” show
the sample expiry as 28 Sep with Monthly on the next line, and describe Desk AI
as a consolidated view across Market Intel, Global Markets and Indian index
movers. Remove the unwanted broker-feed FAQ sentence and migrate only matching
legacy defaults, leaving custom Admin copy untouched.

## V20.30 — 2026-10-14

Increase the landing ticker offset to 25px and add hero bottom clearance so the
floating animated sample preview remains fully visible without overlapping the
ticker.

## V20.29 — 2026-10-14

Reduce the fictional landing-page OI chart from 25 strikes to 11 centered on
ATM to match the compact sample preview. Admin-captured chart data and live
dashboard strike ranges remain unchanged.

## V20.28 — 2026-10-14

Show NIFTY, BANK NIFTY, SENSEX, India VIX, and GIFT NIFTY in the public
landing ticker, followed by all additional Admin-enabled indices. Use the
shared market feeds, show dashes instead of fabricated prices when unavailable,
and move the ticker strip 15px down from the hero.

## V20.27 — 2026-10-14

Refine the landing-page PositionMeter mockup to use less vertical space and
give the Analyze showcase a descriptive caption. Add active-section navigation,
consistent brand accents across section headings and Pro pricing, accessible
FAQ and billing controls, and reduced-motion support.

## V20.26 — 2026-10-14

Replace the Desk AI preview in the Pro landing showcase with a detailed,
fictional PositionMeter interface based on the product screenshot. Apply a
consistent emerald brand accent to the landing section headings and split the
StrikLenz name in the plan heading using the brand colors.

## V20.25 — 2026-10-14

Center the StrikLenz wordmark on the public sign-in card and desktop brand
panel. Improve narrow-screen sign-in spacing, keep taller forms vertically
scrollable, and prevent long headings or controls from being clipped.

## V20.24 — 2026-10-14

Add an explicit Mobile / Tablet compatible marker beneath the landing feature
tiles and reduce the vertical spacing between those tiles and the interactive
product demo.

## V20.23 — 2026-10-14

Center the sign-in hero text, supporting copy, and dashboard preview within the
dark brand panel.

## V20.22 — 2026-10-14

Remove the browser address bar and mock browser frame from the Market
Intelligence, Trade Journal, and Desk AI tiles in the Pro showcase. Present
each preview directly as a product tile to match Analyze; leave the separate
interactive product tour unchanged.

## V20.21 — 2026-10-14

Polish the StrikLenz split-color wordmark across shared, Admin, and sign-in
surfaces. Move the desktop sign-in notice onto the dark brand panel, remove
broker-password reassurance copy, compact the member account control into a
responsive account menu, and start Site Walkthrough with a slim header without
overwriting saved desk density.

## V20.20 — 2026-10-14

Refine the landing-page browser frame so its URL and sample label fit on
smaller screens. Add illustrative Straddle and Market & Global Events previews,
replace the OI Distribution feature card, and retain Admin control over cards.

## V20.19 — 2026-10-14

Allow Admin to set an optional first-period price per paid plan and cadence.
Public pricing shows the regular amount with a diagonal strike and the offer
amount, while checkout attaches the matching Razorpay offer and keeps recurring
cycles at the regular plan price.

## V20.18 — 2026-10-14

Improve the Admin plan pricing cards by separating first-period offer guidance
from the three billing-cadence fields, keeping monthly, quarterly, and yearly
Razorpay offer IDs aligned and easier to scan.

## V20.17 — 2026-10-14

Let Admin configure the public entry's auth wait (5–60 seconds, default 10)
from Admin Settings. The public boot config exposes only this non-sensitive
value, and its fetch overlaps the auth-state request.

## V20.16 — 2026-10-14

Replace the Pro showcase's shared open-interest preview with a responsive
fictional Analyze scenario showing sample legs, payoff curves, and summary data.

## V20.15 — 2026-10-14

Round Market Memory point measurements to one decimal place so floating-point
artifacts do not appear in summary cards or the full-history table.

## V20.14 — 2026-10-14

Give the public entry auth-state request up to 10 seconds (11-second guard)
before showing the backend connection retry screen.

## V20.13 — 2026-10-14

Prevent OI chart axis labels from clipping at the chart's left edge and remove
the duplicate Dashboard selection from the terminal walkthrough.

## V20.12 — 2026-10-14

Keep non-admin Market Memory focused on neutral historical measurements by
hiding support/resistance categories and signed up/down reaction details.
Preserve the full analytical view for Admin.

## V20.11 — 2026-10-14

Separate current Open Interest distribution from OI Change overlays, replace
the Strike Pressure preview graphic with neutral call/put OI measurements, and
expand fictional Index Risk events. Keep member dashboard summaries limited to
neutral measurements by hiding directional sentiment, build-up classifications,
and the GEX direction guide; preserve those existing views for Admin.

## V20.10 — 2026-10-14

Refine landing-page plan walkthroughs with a 25-strike CE/PE chart styled after
the live desk, including an ATM marker, OI scale, and striped/outlined window
changes. Keep OI Change and Open Interest distinct from the neutral Build-up
table and Index Risk calendar. Populate Premium's fictional alert inbox with
OI, Market Intel, Global Markets, constituent-move, and event examples; replace
the repeated Strike Pressure bars and remove preview-only bullish, bearish,
support, and resistance labels. Admin-captured Desk AI and live market/member
data paths remain unchanged.

## V20.09 — 2026-10-14

Add an Admin-controlled guest sign-in switch beneath Google Sign-In, default it
off, and enforce it for new guest entry and approval-token polling while keeping
Google member login independent. Remove the broker FAQ entries and guest-login
copy, move landing-preview quote strips out of the product content, remove the
overlapping decorative hero dot, and keep bullish/bearish labels readable at
compact widths.

## V20.08 — 2026-10-14

Add an Admin-controlled switch for plan “More info” walkthroughs and block the
public plan-detail data endpoints while the switch is off. Expand landing-page
regression coverage for named plan features and the Admin/public toggle flow.

## V20.07 — 2026-10-14

Use the app's NSE holiday calendar when its upload feed is unavailable, add a
Market Intelligence view to the Pro showcase, show a dedicated overnight
risk-factor preview, remove the broker-password hero note, and let Admins edit
landing-page copy and screenshot titles in place.

## V20.06 — 2026-10-14

Allow Admins to capture or refresh the sanitized shared-feed snapshot directly
inside the plan walkthrough preview, then inspect current feed data across the
feature tabs without leaving the preview.

## V20.05 — 2026-10-14

Populate plan walkthroughs with clearly labeled illustrative examples wherever
an Admin-captured feed is missing; tighten Desk AI copy to shared-market
context only; remove hollow OI bar caps and align the landing sample bias; and
show Pro journal and Desk AI terminal previews alongside Positions.

## V20.04 — 2026-10-16

Replace the duplicate Market Structure marketing preview with Global Markets and
Market Intel views, remove the Play control in favor of direct page selection,
and present Desk AI as a captured factual market briefing with heavyweight
weightage/breadth context and no trade suggestions.

## V20.03 — 2026-10-15

Keep member-facing plan previews and dashboard surfaces free of trade-action
guidance; reserve position-aware Desk AI and carry guidance for Admin. Replace
the public walkthrough's empty journal/settings responses with clearly
fictional, in-memory sample entries and remove obsolete OAuth marketing copy.

## V20.02 — 2026-10-15

Replace fabricated market values in plan details with Admin-captured, static shared-app snapshots; configure each plan's feature order and copy, and preview edits in place. Keep subscriber alert history, broker data, positions, and journals out of public captures.

## V20.01 — 2026-10-14

Remove the always-visible dashboard-tab close icons; hide a page from its context menu using right-click, touch long-press, or the keyboard context-menu shortcut, while keeping the existing restore menu.

## V20.00 — 2026-10-14

Replace screenshot-only plan details with interactive Normal, Premium, and Pro feature walkthroughs, including browsable event/holiday and Index Risk previews; keep optional admin screenshots as supporting illustrations. Permanently bind each Pro Google member to the first successful Zerodha identity, including existing linked identities, and reject attempts to connect a different account.

## V19.14 — 2026-10-14

Clarify shared OI freshness versus a member's private broker session, remove the duplicate member broker banner, add persistent hide/restore dashboard tabs, save Premium/Pro OI-shift alerts in each member's inbox, and add plan details with admin-managed screenshots.

## V19.13 — 2026-10-13

Make Market Intel and Overnight Hold popups larger and resizable on desktop, remember each popup's dimensions, keep phone sheets within the viewport, and improve Market Intel story text readability.

## V19.12 — 2026-10-13

Keep Market Intel within the usable viewport at browser zoom levels and dock it opposite Overnight Hold when either popup is moved to a screen side. During the configured indicative-price window, show NIFTY and SENSEX together in the sidebar above Expiries Included.

## V19.11 — 2026-10-13

Use the Positions Trade Journal experience for Pro members, with private daily P&L summaries, calendar/year/period statistics, notes, tags, and screenshots. Member snapshots store aggregates only; detailed position legs and trade cycles remain controlled by the existing admin opt-in.

## V19.10 — 2026-10-13

Clarify subscription payment/access states and pending checkout recovery; cover provider-driven cancellation, payment failure, expiry, and full-refund entitlements; add member-removable encrypted broker credentials, rejected-session refresh handling, redacted admin/member audit history, and member data-retention documentation.

## V19.09 — 2026-10-13

Keep Pro broker app credentials encrypted and linked to each Google member identity across daily session expiry, sign-out, and plan lapses; show masked saved credentials, a daily request-token refresh action, clear stale-session guidance, and the connected broker account ID in the member header and Positions toolbar.

## V19.08 — 2026-10-13

Allow Pro members to save their own encrypted broker API key and secret, generate an app-specific login link, automatically exchange callback request tokens, or manually paste a request token; changing credentials invalidates the prior session.

## V19.07 — 2026-10-13

Add dedicated admin controls for public landing-page section and card visibility, including a default-hidden broker directory, without changing broker integration or plan entitlements.

## V19.06 — 2026-10-13

Move Indicative Price from the draggable popup into a fixed sidebar display during its configured window, make it available across all plans, and remove obsolete popup controls.

## V19.05 — 2026-10-13

Route broker OAuth redirects through the authenticated app callback bridge, exchange the one-time token into the member's encrypted broker session, return to Positions, and prevent duplicate callback exchanges.

## V19.04 — 2026-10-13

Make alert sound settings an admin-grantable member entitlement (off for Normal by default), use generic broker-credential wording in member Positions, add visible member sign-out controls, and present the private Pro journal as a member-scoped calendar without exposing admin P&L.

## V19.03 — 2026-10-13

Expose the public landing-page switch alongside membership rollout and plan configuration in Admin Settings, retain the dashboard-header control, and deny CAS desk/status/backtest access to subscription members while preserving admin and guest behavior.

## V19.02 — 2026-10-13

Bound public-entry authentication loading with a retryable timeout and add loopback-only local member test accounts for Normal, Premium, and Pro without enabling password login outside development.

## V19.01 — 2026-10-13

Make the public landing page consistently show all three admin-configurable plans, with feature lists aligned to actual entitlements, clear shared-feed versus Pro broker-data boundaries, and signup/checkout calls to action gated by provider readiness.

## V19.00 — 2026-10-10

Add the Normal / Premium / Pro membership foundation: Google member sessions independent of guest access, admin-managed plan entitlements and subscriber controls, private member preferences and Pro journal, personalized in-app OI alerts with 09:00 IST retention, and Razorpay subscription checkout/cancellation with signed webhook entitlement updates.

## V18.54 — 2026-10-09

Broaden Market Intel coverage with a dedicated India-linked international company news feed and ensure material news naming uploaded NIFTY / SENSEX constituents is retained and scored as India-relevant, including IT, steel, chemicals, and construction developments.

## V18.53 — 2026-10-09

Move Market Intel outcome, confidence, volatility, and catalyst measurements below the news feed so the ranked headlines remain the first focus while preserving access to the same data.

## V18.52 — 2026-10-09

Keep Market Intel outcome samples at the event-cluster level; compare direction hit rates across heuristic-strength bands, add sample-gated volatility outcome breakdowns for RBI, crude, global rates, and earnings catalysts, and show a cautious short-option exposure review note on the feed and popup.

## V18.51 — 2026-10-09

Measure Market Intel volatility reads independently from direction: compare observed India VIX changes and each index's post-story high-low range with the preceding equal-length window. Keep unavailable snapshot coverage separate and withhold response rates until each risk-read/horizon group has 30 observations.

## V18.50 — 2026-10-09

Improve Market Intel evidence: separately assess volatility catalysts and India transmission, distinguish publisher time from app receipt and market-session timing, combine deduplicated independent-source directional reads, and measure direction alignment against existing NIFTY / SENSEX / BANKNIFTY snapshots at 15 minutes, one hour, and session close. Keep after-hours outcomes separate, exclude small moves, and hide hit rates until each index/horizon has 30 scored samples.

## V18.49 — 2026-10-09

Make Market Intel direction immediately scannable with up/down arrows and clear “market up” / “market down” labels; color the news popup surface to match likely direction. Reduce false directional readings by prioritizing headlines over summaries, marking summary-derived cues as less direct, suppressing negated price cues, and requiring Indian-market relevance for company-specific news.

## V18.48 — 2026-10-09

Separate Market Intel event importance from a new explainable headline-direction score for likely Indian-market support, pressure, mixed evidence, or unclear direction; show the assessment with restrained green/red/amber/neutral UI on the news feed and popup, and retain an explanation plus rule-confidence disclosure.

## V18.47 — 2026-10-08

Add a Journal toggle to pause/resume saving future admin trade-cycle history without deleting existing cycles or changing daily Journal P&L; guest cycle history remains independent.

## V18.46 — 2026-10-07

Give archive compaction/deletion a two-minute browser timeout, batch verified archive deletions with ownership/status/date rechecks, and advise admins to refresh the range before retrying an ambiguous timed-out request.

## V18.45 — 2026-10-07

Replace the Trade Journal cycle archive's month/age selection with an exact inclusive Exit Date range shared by preview, download, compaction, and permanent deletion; continue accepting existing monthly archive uploads.

## V18.44 — 2026-10-07

Stop Desk AI and carry-brief OI-change requests outside the active OI polling window, using `/market/status` and failing closed if the status cannot be read.

## V18.43 — 2026-10-07

Extend Trade Journal cycle archives with a verified permanent-delete option for one eligible closed month, allow downloading the remaining summaries after compaction, and let admins upload gzip NDJSON archives for a separate browser-tab-only calendar view that never writes to MongoDB.

## V18.42 — 2026-10-07

Make the Trade Journal cycle-archive age selectable from 1–365 days, defaulting to 30, and apply the chosen threshold consistently to eligible-month listing, archive download, and compaction verification.

## V18.41 — 2026-10-07

Stop suppressing or deleting current session-day P&L just because its values match the previous session. Add admin-only monthly trade-cycle archives with explicit, hash-verified compaction after the download is saved outside the app; daily P&L and compact summaries remain in MongoDB.

## V18.40 — 2026-10-07

Refined phone layout for Admin settings: the two save actions stack at full width below the scrolling controls, remain visible, and wrap their setting-count badges cleanly on narrow screens.

## V18.39 — 2026-10-07

Info tiles now share one open dropdown at a time across Holiday, FII/DII, Events, and Index Impact, on both desktop and mobile rows.

## V18.38 — 2026-10-07

Settings dialogs keep their save actions visible while the settings content scrolls, and use clearer StrikLenz palette colors for desk and personal saves.

## V18.37 — 2026-10-07

Split settings persistence into separate desk/server and personal/browser saves. Each action shows a count of changed settings, reports its own save status, and can be retried independently.

## V18.36 — 2026-10-07

Admin configuration now shows explicit load/save health, last successful save times, inline save errors, and separate server/browser storage labels. Positions refresh help explains request-start cadence and non-overlapping requests.

## V18.35 — 2026-10-07

Admin settings now remove retired dashboard page and underlying IDs from saved selection lists, weekday defaults, and lot-size maps. Mixed old/new lists retain valid selections when saved, while lists with no current required selections still fail validation.

## V18.34 — 2026-10-07

Admin settings now filter retired dashboard page IDs such as `ipo-watch` from saved settings reads, preventing unrelated settings changes from failing validation.

## V18.33 — 2026-10-07

Positions refresh now accepts any whole-second interval from 1 to 3600. Its cadence is measured between request starts, so response time is no longer added to the configured delay; overlapping broker-book requests remain prevented.

## V18.32 — 2026-10-07

Strike Pressure now identifies the first post-refresh sample as “Warming up” instead of implying a neutral reading. Positions and Header Today P&L now default to a shared 2-second live-session refresh, configurable from 2 to 3600 seconds in Admin settings.

## V18.31 — 2026-10-07

Simplified Positions instrument metadata: CALL/PUT now appears before the product type, and product labels such as NRML/MIS are plain text rather than badges.

## V18.30 — 2026-10-07

Reduced desktop Positions table width with responsive, weighted columns and tighter cell padding. All user-configurable columns remain available, with horizontal scrolling retained as a fallback at narrower widths.

## V18.29 — 2026-10-07

Restored clear semantic colors in Strike Pressure: direction and impact now share the favorable, caution, and high-risk tones, while neutral readings remain understated.

## V18.28 — 2026-10-07

Softened the Positions instrument metadata palette: product tags are neutral, CALL/PUT tags use lighter semantic tints, and quantity/expiry details are quieter while P&L and risk colors remain distinct.

## V18.27 — 2026-10-07

Aligned the warning threshold and PositionMeter controls on the far right of the Live Positions row, using the existing neutral toolbar styling.

## V18.26 — 2026-10-07

Moved the Positions privacy control to the far right of the outer “My Positions” heading, keeping it separate from the inner “Live Positions” row.

## V18.25 — 2026-10-07

Moved the Positions privacy control to the far right of the title row and grouped the warning threshold with the action toolbar to make the heading cleaner and preserve working space.

## V18.24 — 2026-10-07

Refined the Positions workspace with a calmer neutral surface and toolbar, clearer table headers and row scanning, and a distinct “Live Positions” inner heading. Configurable metric tiles, position data, and actions are unchanged.

## V18.23 — 2026-10-07

Stabilized the GEX estimate by limiting contributions to valid option legs within a fixed ±3% spot band, using the configured contract lot size instead of outdated hardcoded multipliers, and showing how many chain strikes contributed. The reading remains an estimate and updates with new market snapshots.

## V18.22 — 2026-10-07

Kept the dashboard event-tile borders clearly visible on hover without shifting or washing out the tile, and increased the text size and spacing across the holiday, FII/DII, event, and index-impact tiles for easier reading.

## V18.21 — 2026-10-06

Removed the deprecated TypeScript `baseUrl` setting from the frontend JavaScript project config while preserving the `@/` source alias.

## V18.20 — 2026-10-06

Kept the GEX guide available after expiry by calculating against the snapshot timestamp and, when that chain has expired, using the last valid snapshot from the same IST session. The retained reading is timestamped and does not carry directional confirmation from newer data.

## V18.19 — 2026-10-06

Added alerts for newly arriving impact-ranked Market Intel stories: an in-app toast while the desk is open and an OS notification when backgrounded if desk notifications are enabled. Existing queued headlines are baselined on first load to prevent stale alert bursts. Centered and enlarged the phone GEX sheet slightly, keeping a small edge margin.

## V18.18 — 2026-10-05

Replaced the anchored phone GEX popover with a compact, viewport-bounded bottom sheet that stays above the mobile navigation, keeps the key reading and direction check first, scrolls supporting detail internally, and dismisses on outside tap. Desktop retains its anchored popover.

## V18.17 — 2026-10-05

Made the GEX guide compact on phones by prioritizing the current reading and directional check, with thresholds and strike areas available in expandable sections. Kept the previous GEX formatter export name available to avoid runtime failures when cached frontend chunks are mixed during deployment.

## V18.16 — 2026-10-05

Added a separate, cautious GEX-panel direction check. It shows an upward or downward lean only when price change, selected-window OI change, and the existing combined dashboard bias agree; incomplete or conflicting inputs produce “No clear direction” or “Signals disagree.” Clarified that GEX estimates move conditions, not direction.

## V18.15 — 2026-10-05

Made the GEX guide fit phone screens with viewport-bounded width and height, horizontal overflow protection, and compact three-across threshold cards. Locked the minimized Market Intel chip to the phone's bottom-right corner regardless of saved desktop position.

## V18.14 — 2026-10-05

Added left, center, and right docking controls to the Market Intel popup, matching the Overnight brief. New users get the popup on the right by default; dragged and snapped positions remain saved per browser.

## V18.13 — 2026-10-05

Clarified the GEX guide with explicit positive, neutral, and negative cutoffs, the current value's comparison to its cutoff, and a plain-language explanation for each range. Reworked the thresholds into readable phone-width rows and explained that ₹0.5 L Cr equals ₹50,000 crore.

## V18.12 — 2026-10-05

Corrected the GEX amount to estimated rupee hedging notional per 1% index move and present it in Indian lakh/crore units. The guide now makes the unverified calls-positive/puts-negative assumption and selected expiry explicit, alongside the timestamp and largest strike watch areas. Improved recovery from stale JavaScript/CSS chunks with a cooldown-limited cache-busting reload, and documented production cache/deployment requirements.

## V18.11 — 2026-10-05

Made GEX compact on phone screens, reduced the strike visualization to the three largest areas, and switched displayed GEX values and thresholds to Indian lakh-crore notation across the dashboard and Sell Candidates. Added a concise explanation of what the unit and colored bars mean.

## V18.10 — 2026-10-05

Made the GEX popover phone-friendly with responsive width and internal scrolling, and explained that T is a model-scale trillion rather than rupees changing hands or index points. The strike chart now explains green/positive and red/negative values in terms of this model’s call-side and put-side estimates.

## V18.09 — 2026-10-05

Added the OI snapshot time and a ranked, signed view of the largest modeled GEX strike areas. Clarified that these areas are not support/resistance and that GEX does not reveal dealers’ actual positions or predict market direction. The total GEX calculation now always uses the full available option chain, independent of the chart’s visible strike range.

## V18.08 — 2026-10-05

Rewrote the GEX popover in plain language, added a visual three-zone market-regime guide, and clarified a cautious action for the current reading. GEX remains an estimate and is not presented as a standalone trade signal.

## V18.07 — 2026-10-05

Added a dedicated GEX levels popover beside the OI Change replay controls. It explains the dealer-gamma regime for the current index, shows today’s GEX value, and clarifies how positive vs negative gamma exposure changes market behavior.

## V18.06 — 2026-10-04

Align route isolation with React Router's case-insensitive walkthrough matching so case or encoded path variants cannot bypass the demo API and WebSocket guards.

## V18.05 — 2026-10-04

Keep the walkthrough explicitly disabled when site maintenance ends, including sites where maintenance was already active before walkthrough gating was deployed.

## V18.04 — 2026-10-04

Keep the walkthrough unavailable and visibly off during site-wide maintenance; prevent enabling it until maintenance is cleared, then require the admin to enable it manually.

## V18.03 — 2026-10-04

Fixed persistence for the Site walkthrough toggle, made site-wide maintenance turn the walkthrough off until an admin explicitly re-enables it, and populated the preview with four realistic fictional Market Intelligence items and four sample alerts.

## V18.02 — 2026-10-04

Moved the public walkthrough switch from Admin configuration into the header's Admin Settings menu, added a branded no-market-data maintenance screen when the preview is disabled, and populated the isolated walkthrough with labelled Desk AI sample context and stable-cadence strike alerts.

## V18.01 — 2026-10-03

Made the public walkthrough's fictional indices, OI, option premiums, positions, and straddles move coherently during NSE market hours. The demo follows regular 09:15–15:30 IST sessions and listed special-session hours, reuses the prior session close outside market hours, and refreshes demo index quotes more frequently without changing normal dashboard polling.

## V18.00 — 2026-10-03

Added an anonymous `/sitewalkthrough` view of the real StrikLenz dashboard, backed by fictional sample fixtures and route-scoped in-memory writes. CAS and admin-only surfaces are excluded; the dashboard cannot reach market/account APIs, MongoDB, or broker services. Added an administrator toggle under Dashboard pages and public landing-page entry points.

## V17.13 — 2026-10-01

Polished the Positions phone header into clear title, status, and warning-control rows, shortened the phone-only PositionMeter label to "PMeter," and tightened mobile sizing to prevent the Positions panel from overflowing its viewport. Desktop labels and all controls remain unchanged.

## V17.12 — 2026-09-30

Added a compact PositionMeter "Check now" list for urgent sold legs with same-strike hedge quantities, paired expiry-day/near-strike attention using existing Positions flags, an explicit LTP-before-costs premium-capture note, and visibility into the existing booked-loss and available-margin guards.

## V17.11 — 2026-09-30

Expanded PositionMeter with open-short premium captured and weighted capture percentage, renamed decay runway to "Premium left to decay," added named near-strike/risk explanations and urgency-first full-book sorting, showed same-strike CE/PE hedge offsets, and made Positions-read freshness and missing option quote timestamps explicit.

## V17.10 — 2026-09-30

Added the existing broker-reported booked-plus-open Today P&L to PositionMeter and a clearly qualified "Still to earn" estimate for remaining extrinsic value in open short options. The estimate excludes hedge costs and is withheld when a short leg lacks data.

## V17.09 — 2026-09-30

Reduced PositionMeter's default page height by removing the all-book scenario chart and risk-distribution bar from the main view, collapsing strike/scenario details per expiry, and reducing the summary to open P&L, net Delta, and alerts. Extra whole-book estimates remain available in a collapsed section.

## V17.08 — 2026-09-30

Made PositionMeter seller-focused: sold options are tested with same-index, same-expiry bought hedges together, bought legs are not alerted for premium decay alone, and positions group by expiry with strikes in ascending order. Added package-level net Greeks, P&L, stress scenarios, and CE/PE buy/sell quantities by strike. Threshold explanations now use the current close value of sold options in the package.

## V17.07 — 2026-09-30

Simplified PositionMeter’s risk visualization into plain-language market changes with estimated rupee outcomes, moved advanced scenarios behind an expandable section, and kept risk-method details available without filling the default view with Greek terminology.

## V17.06 — 2026-09-30

Added an INR-normalized Greek sensitivity visualization with net and gross leg impacts, withheld incomplete-book totals instead of showing partial exposures, clarified that IV/Greeks are model-derived rather than direct Kite quotes, and documented parameter units, alert mechanics, assumptions, and authoritative options references.

## V17.05 — 2026-09-30

Explained implied volatility and IV-point changes in plain language, made the Watch / High alert calculation and thresholds visible on PositionMeter, and showed each position's reason directly on mobile cards.

## V17.04 — 2026-09-30

Improved PositionMeter readability with larger type, clearer position summaries, a position-risk distribution bar, and zero-centered scenario impact bars with a shared scale. Increased mobile-card and settings legibility while preserving the compact desktop workspace.

## V17.03 — 2026-09-30

Replaced PositionMeter's small-move Greek scenario arithmetic with option repricing for price, IV, and time shocks, bounded long-option scenario losses by the current option value, and reset old browser alert preferences to clearer default thresholds. Added plain-language alert explanations showing the tested move and estimated position loss.

## V17.02 — 2026-09-30

Renamed the Positions risk subpage to PositionMeter and moved its entry button to the right side of the My Positions header. Simplified the default risk table, made exposure units explicit, and moved detailed option prices and IV movement into expandable explanations.

## V17.01 — 2026-09-30

Retry transient MongoDB startup connection failures with bounded backoff so the OI tracker can initialize when the database becomes reachable. Straddle history now returns the standard readiness response while the tracker is unavailable instead of raising an unhandled 500.

## V17.00 — 2026-09-30

Added an internal Risk Management view under Positions with portfolio summaries, position-level Greeks and explanations, configurable stress thresholds, and explicitly estimated price / IV / time scenarios. It reuses the existing Positions feed and reports missing or stale inputs rather than inventing values. Kite login now checks backend readiness before exchanging a one-time request token.

## V16.05 — 2026-09-30

Recognized compact BSE weekly option expiry month codes in Positions, restoring parsed strike/side/expiry fields and expiry-matched short/long markers on OI Change and Open Interest charts.

## V16.04 — 2026-09-29

Improved Desk AI session brief readability with larger, separate evidence cards, plain-language OI labels, clearly labeled sources and timestamps, and distinct live/stale status badges.

## V16.03 — 2026-09-29

Separated Desk AI's model/rule interpretation from observed market data, disclosed available and missing evidence timestamps plus clear GIFT/breadth disagreements, and added market-phase-aware pre-open, session, and closeout briefs.

## V16.02 — 2026-09-29

Enabled Left/Right keyboard shortcuts for cycling Admin dialogs while protecting editable fields, enlarged the phone dialog navigation touch targets, and clarified Desk AI's upcoming company-results and board-meeting tile.

## V16.01 — 2026-09-29

Moved Admin dialog previous/next navigation beside each popup title and replaced the labeled buttons with compact, accessible arrow controls.

## V16.00 — 2026-09-29

Added owner-scoped learning from historical trade outcomes for more personal Desk AI suggestions, with read-only safeguards and evidence limits. Admin dialogs can be cycled without closing and reopening the menu. Market Memory now balances historically supported zones above and below spot when both sides have evidence, rather than showing only a one-sided nearest-level list.

## V15.00 — 2026-09-29

Introduced a read-only Desk AI analyst agent that compares timestamped OI, GIFT/VIX, outside tape, book, and journal evidence, calls out coverage limits and conflicts, and provides conditional carry scenarios. It cannot change app settings, code, trading logic, or place trades; the deterministic carry verdict remains authoritative.

## V14.94 — 2026-09-29

Reduced default Market Intel feed and public-source refresh delays to one minute, kept keyed API and Firecrawl polling at a five-minute minimum, refreshed the in-app popup every minute, and made popup eligibility honor the user's impact and India-relevance thresholds.

## V14.93 — 2026-09-29

Improved visibility of every index regime label with larger, bolder text, dark high-contrast text, and consistent colors: red for bear, blue for ranging, green for bull, rose for risk-off, and amber for quiet.

## V14.92 — 2026-09-29

Stopped guest sessions from being restored by shared IP/name, removed guest Kite-book lookup by IP/name, and isolated Desk Guide LLM caches by authenticated caller and compact snapshot. Guest LLM refreshes now respect a global provider cooldown, and snapshot content is explicitly untrusted in model instructions.

## V14.91 — 2026-09-29

Fixed standalone Node execution of position and Black-Scholes regression tests by replacing a webpack-only market-time import alias with a same-directory relative import.

## V14.90 — 2026-09-29

Show a Pre-market status from the 09:00 NSE pre-open until OI polling begins at 09:15, instead of marking the expected prior-session snapshot stale.

## V14.89 — 2026-09-29

Fixed Global Markets settings on phones by using a full-screen, safe-area-aware modal and stacking each instrument's controls into a compact layout instead of clipping them offscreen.

## V14.88 — 2026-09-29

Kept the maintenance hero and actions centered in their own area while returning the phone artwork to a bounded NIFTY-left, fully contained robot-right layout. Short phones use a smaller illustration without introducing page or panel scrolling.

## V14.87 — 2026-09-29

Centered the maintenance hero copy and actions across the phone viewport, replaced the synthetic NIFTY curve with saved underlying-price history, and added a reduced-motion-aware animated trace. The NIFTY card now blends into the page instead of using a near-black fill, and its chart aligns with the hero to use phone space better.

## V14.86 — 2026-09-29

Centered the maintenance status pills and shared app mark, improved the phone illustration scale and spacing, and restored a compact four-feature footer on phones while retaining the full feature footer on larger screens.

## V14.85 — 2026-09-29

Reworked the maintenance page for phones: it now stays within the viewport without scrolling, places the NIFTY panel to the robot's left, removes the bench, and keeps a compact branded footer visible. Fixed the Market Memory visibility setting being omitted from the backend persistence allowlist.

## V14.84 — 2026-09-29

Made Market Memory relevance fade over a bounded 20-day window, fixed latest-interaction and India-local day counting, corrected card metric labels, and refreshed the summary every 30 seconds with explicit freshness/error states. Added a shared Admin Config visibility setting and an initial maintenance-page mobile layout adjustment.

## V14.83 — 2026-09-29

Added branded, reduced-motion-aware startup and panel loading states. OI and Straddle charts now keep existing data visible while refreshing and show explicit unavailable states when no snapshot or session data can be displayed.

## V14.82 — 2026-09-29

Matched the active timeframe pill and OI change-date label to the existing emerald/teal selected strike-filter style, with accessible pressed state. Added a reusable, read-only local end-to-end audit procedure and a sanitized report from the September 29 run.

## V14.81 — 2026-09-29

Prevented Admin Config and Market Intel settings from saving fallback defaults after a failed read, made ADR poll feedback reflect the actual poll result, rejected non-positive or non-finite ADR thresholds in the UI and API, and changed API Configuration's Active count to providers with recorded calls today. Documented that Twelve Data's per-instrument cadence does not enforce the Free plan's aggregate daily-credit allowance.

## V14.80 — 2026-09-29

Added an opt-in, backend-enforced admin authentication bypass for loopback-only local development, with a production fail-closed guard, visible dashboard warning, focused tests, and coding-agent documentation.

## V14.79 — 2026-09-29

Limited Twelve Data usage by polling ADRs only during the US equity session at a minimum ten-minute cadence, removed the pre-US Indian-open refresh, and added the same ten-minute per-instrument gate to Global Markets Twelve Data requests. FMP remains opt-in per enabled instrument/provider assignment.

## V14.78 — 2026-09-26

Made the maintenance page fit phone viewports, reduced the robot and NIFTY chart sizes on mobile, compacted the maintenance actions, and removed the admin sign-in link.

## V14.77 — 2026-09-25

Refreshed the dark palette from muted blue-gray to a modern deep navy with brighter cyan/emerald accents, clearer surface hierarchy, and improved dark-mode text contrast.

## V14.76 — 2026-09-25

Refined the dark theme to use softened blue-green desk surfaces, stronger but muted separation, readable App text, and matching dark alert panels instead of near-black surfaces.

## V14.75 — 2026-09-25

Made phone Admin tools tile labels compact and overflow-safe so text stays inside each tile on narrow screens.

## V14.74 — 2026-09-25

Reserved the full first row of the phone Admin tools grid for the Admin tools title and close button, moving the toggle tiles to the following row.

## V14.73 — 2026-09-25

Made Indicative popup and Public landing use matching compact ON/OFF tiles on phone and tablet admin tools, eliminating the oversized Indicative popup row.

## V14.72 — 2026-09-25

Compacted the phone admin-tools sheet, reduced maintenance and account-action spacing, and changed the Indicative price popup control to a compact ON/OFF tile matching the Public landing control style.

## V14.71 — 2026-09-25

Improved mobile and tablet admin-tool spacing with consistent two- and three-column grids, full-width controls, aligned headings, and clearer button sizing.

## V14.70 — 2026-09-25

Centered the Global Markets settings header, improved mobile admin-tool spacing, made the indicative-price popup a consistent tile toggle, and opened Broker & Payments in a new tab.

## V14.69 — 2026-09-25

Made API Configuration summary and filters collapsible on mobile, kept Global Markets settings open when optional ADR configuration fails, and renamed the related notification to Global Markets.

## V14.68 — 2026-09-25

Made the frontend lint command warning-free and expanded the canonical AI change checklist with package, dependency, supply-chain, and rollback risk controls.

## V14.67 — 2026-09-25

Added an ESLint 9 flat configuration, separated Jest suites from standalone checks, configured the frontend `@/` Jest alias and shared browser test setup, and made the frontend build script work on Windows shells.

## V14.66 — 2026-09-25

Added the canonical change-maintenance checklist for all human, AI, and agent changes. It defines frontend/backend file locations, meaningful comment rules, stale-comment updates, tests, documentation, versioning, protected-data checks, and shipping steps.

## V14.65 — 2026-09-25

Renamed the external Broker & Payments settings entry and the in-dashboard Admin Configs entry. Wired the configured ordinary-alert opacity to desktop, mobile, and hidden-alert inbox surfaces, with regression coverage for alert routing.

## V14.64 — 2026-09-25

Corrected stale frontend test expectations and clarified the split between standalone Node assertion tests and Jest tests so full validation reports are accurate.

## V14.63 — 2026-09-25

Added a protected live-data change checklist covering OI, Positions, Straddle, CAS, snapshots, and broker-data ownership. Renamed the admin settings menu entry to Broker & Payments and retained API Configuration data between modal opens while bounding recent telemetry loading.

## V14.62 — 2026-09-25

Made the maintenance market strip a full-width continuous loop and retained the last successful VIX/GIFT NIFTY values across temporary extras-feed failures, with faster recovery polling and broader payload field handling.

## V14.61 — 2026-09-25

Fixed the mobile dashboard crash caused by a missing `useCallback` import and added regression coverage for immediate fresh OI polling after a Kite token update.

## V14.60 — 2026-09-25

Made a successful Kite token update trigger an immediate live OI refresh and coordinated dashboard status, chart, positions, and ticker reloads instead of waiting for the next polling interval.

## V14.59 — 2026-09-25

Fixed the maintenance ticker row so all market quotes stay on one horizontal line and loop left-to-right reliably, including when stylesheet ordering or hot reload leaves layout utilities stale.

## V14.58 — 2026-09-25

Made the maintenance page use a compact looping NIFTY/SENSEX strip and the admin-login footer layout, removed its duplicate quote row, and added configurable visibility and drag ordering for the Global Markets session timeline.

## V14.57 — 2026-09-25

Made the market state live from NSE pre-open at 09:00 while keeping OI polling separately gated until the exact 09:15 session open, with holiday-aware pre-open wake-up and no overnight or post-close status polling.

## V14.56 — 2026-09-25

Kept dashboard status polling active outside market hours so the desk transitions into live mode automatically at the configured open, removed silent straddle expiry substitution, and made straddle history session filtering use configured market hours.

## V14.55 — 2026-09-24

Restored smooth OI and OI-change bar animation with a short update-aware transition keyed to snapshot timestamps, avoiding unnecessary replay during unchanged chart rerenders.

## V14.54 — 2026-09-24

Updated Motor and PyMongo for the Python 3.14 runtime and made admin authentication return a clear temporary database-unavailable response when MongoDB cannot complete a connection.

## V14.53 — 2026-09-24

Removed the guest-login action from the dedicated admin login, made the mobile admin login fit the viewport without page scrolling, added a version footer, and enabled a continuous mobile market ticker loop.

## V14.52 — 2026-09-24

Made OI and OI-change bars redraw immediately instead of replaying multiple animated Recharts layers on every live poll, while preserving the Sensibull-style green put/red call and increase/decrease treatments.

## V14.51 — 2026-09-24

Improved mobile admin tools layering, reduced the live status rail to seconds on phones, and clearly shows that OI auto-refresh is stopped when the market is closed.

## V14.50 — 2026-09-24

Fixed the dedicated admin host route so a successful sign-in reaches the authenticated dashboard instead of rendering the login page again.

## V14.49 — 2026-09-24

Kept configured ADR rows visible while closed, showing CLOSED and last-known data instead of incorrectly prompting for configuration. Closed instruments are skipped only by the polling path.

## V14.48 — 2026-09-24

Gated Global Markets and ADR polling per instrument session so closed venues no longer consume provider credits; closed rows retain their last known observations and show their session state. Added the current release notes to the in-app Version modal.

## V14.47 — 2026-09-24

Added a shared rolling Twelve Data credit limiter across ADR and Global Markets polling to prevent Basic-plan 429 storms while preserving last successful observations and existing provider behavior.

## V14.46 — 2026-09-24

Kept ADR Monitor independently visible and usable when the Global Markets feed is disabled; the master feed toggle now hides only global instrument tables and never controls ADR page availability.

## V14.45 — 2026-09-24

Separated the Global Markets data-feed toggle from ADR page visibility and ADR Monitor enablement. Global Markets settings no longer rewrite dashboard navigation settings, failed toggle saves no longer leave a false local state, and the ADR control now clearly identifies its own scope.

## V14.44 — 2026-09-24

Completed the restrained visual roadmap with data-aware P&L and position-change feedback, Market Memory refresh pulses, Global Markets and ADR live-state surfaces, position heatmap interaction polish, session timeline presentation, and an optional CSS-only landing-page depth scene. All new motion respects reduced-motion preferences and leaves APIs, polling, authentication, trading logic, and OI/S-L behavior unchanged.

## V14.43 — 2026-09-24

Added a shared restrained depth/3D visual system for cards, tabs, dialogs, sheets, and drawers with pointer-safe hover lift and explicit reduced-motion support.

## V14.42 — 2026-09-24

Made source hiding the single Error Log control, removed the legacy News API hide button, and clarified duplicate-looking `UI`/`Boundary` source labels.

## V14.41 — 2026-09-24

Restored the public maintenance screen at the normal local/root entry point when maintenance mode is enabled, while keeping the dedicated admin host and authenticated admin access available.

## V14.40 — 2026-09-24

Changed the admin error log timestamps to IST and added a persisted source-hide dropdown for selectively hiding noisy Global Markets, ADR, news, or other error sources.

## V14.39 — 2026-09-24

Restored smooth bottom-up OI bar growth with a shorter transition and removed mark hover handlers that could interrupt S/L glow animation during pointer movement.

## V14.38 — 2026-09-24

Removed overlapping live OI bar animations that caused the option-chain chart to jitter and render broken intermediate bar states during updates.

## V14.37 — 2026-09-24

Reduced initial dashboard network work by avoiding the delayed OI refresh when the requested multi-window payload is already present.

## V14.36 — 2026-09-24

Expanded the Market Memory detail sheet for all-column explanations, a wider desktop layout, responsive horizontal scrolling, and a sticky level column for easier navigation.

## V14.35 — 2026-09-24

Expanded Market Memory with directional reactions, recent versus historical comparisons, breakout and failed-retest rates, per-interaction market context, and live freshness indicators.

## V14.34 — 2026-09-24

Added Market Memory info guidance explaining interactions, average reaction, distance, strength, and the historical—not predictive—meaning of the panel.

## V14.33 — 2026-09-24

Fixed the maintenance screen for mobile by preventing content overlap, allowing natural scrolling, reducing decorative scene scale, and improving small-screen spacing.

## V14.32 — 2026-09-24

Polished the dedicated admin login with clearer security status, stronger form hierarchy, improved field focus states, refined spacing, and better responsive composition.

## V14.31 — 2026-09-24

Refined the guest login experience with a calmer card layout, clearer hierarchy, improved input treatment, stronger action feedback, and better responsive spacing.

## V14.30 — 2026-09-24

Hide Google sign-in on the guest login page whenever public landing mode is disabled; guest authentication remains available.

## V14.29 — 2026-09-24

Completed the final hardening pass: upgraded Starlette to the first compatible patched release, added DNS-rebinding-resistant Market Intel fetching, and added regression coverage for private DNS targets and authorization boundaries.

## V14.28 — 2026-09-24

Hardened production host and CORS defaults, disabled public API documentation by default, prevented spoofed forwarding headers from controlling IP-based security decisions, and documented the required proxy and production settings.

## V14.26 — 2026-09-23

Unified the login and maintenance footers while preserving the original desk features, restored live chart candles, improved the robot's circular eyes and glowing chest logo, added a clearer open-laptop silhouette and coffee mug handle, moved the workflow copy into a dedicated readable treatment, and clarified Market Memory reaction and distance metrics.

## V14.25 — 2026-09-23

Refined the entry and maintenance visuals: reduced warm/orange status styling, removed duplicate login slogans and decorative candle/bar graphics, improved readability of the discipline workflow, added a rotating maintenance wrench, upgraded the robot coffee mug silhouette, clarified Live Positions, removed the unnecessary ticker arrow, and refreshed the footer with Global Market, World Market News, Straddle, and Events.

## V14.24 — 2026-09-23

Improved the login desk readability and hierarchy, moved Desk P&L above the desk scene, placed VIX and GIFT NIFTY before the main indices in the live ticker, connected the login OI pulse to the live NIFTY snapshot, refreshed Global Markets immediately after FMP connection testing, and tightened the Straddle near-zero outlier guard.

## V14.23 — 2026-09-23

Audited the recent desk changes, connected the login ticker and monitor to the live public ticker feed with a safe fallback, replaced alert exclamation icons with the StrikLenz pulse mark using notification tone colors, and removed broker-provider branding from user-facing positions and connection copy.

## V14.22 — 2026-09-23

Cleaned up the maintenance screen by removing legacy duplicate coffee and status-caption elements, keeping the shared robot scene as the single visual treatment, and centering the footer message across desktop and mobile layouts.

## V14.21 — 2026-09-23

Fixed the authentication scene runtime error caused by the missing Coffee icon import.

## V14.20 — 2026-09-23

Unified the login and maintenance experiences around the reusable StrikLenz robot mascot. Added the discipline-focused trading-desk hero, lightweight NIFTY candlestick/MA monitor, decorative Desk P&L card, happy robot animation, generic brewing laptop state, shared reduced-motion handling, and responsive premium terminal styling without changing authentication behavior.

## V14.19 — 2026-09-23

Changed the admin login heading to “Welcome”, redesigned the auth robot with smiling arc eyes and no tear-like glow, and restored both horizontal and vertical Straddle chart grid lines with stronger visible contrast.

## V14.18 — 2026-09-23

Added explicit horizontal Straddle chart guides with stable y-axis ticks. Reduced chart-opening and live-update work by isolating the refresh countdown from Recharts and bounding display-only points for long sessions while retaining the full series in state.

## V14.17 — 2026-09-23

Made away-alert handling consistent across desktop and phone views. The alert indicator now opens every queued alert, closes on outside click or X, and clears once dismissed. Improved the auth-scene robot with a clear smiling, happy expression.

## V14.16 — 2026-09-23

Rebuilt the admin and guest authentication screens to match the supplied StrikLenz trading-studio reference: market ticker rail, animated 3D-style robot and coffee scene, live chart monitors, branded glass login card, and responsive phone layout.

## V14.15 — 2026-09-23

Changed the mobile alert summary into an expandable alert list. Clicking the alert count now shows every queued alert, and closing the expanded tray dismisses the full visited set instead of leaving the count behind.

## V14.14 — 2026-09-23

Made Global Markets provider polling explicitly selection-driven: FMP and Twelve Data calls are skipped when no enabled instrument is assigned to that provider. Manual FMP testing is also disabled unless an enabled FMP instrument exists.

## V14.13 — 2026-09-23

Corrected provider switching so an instrument moved from Twelve Data to FMP automatically receives its documented FMP default symbol instead of retaining a stale Twelve Data symbol. Deliberate custom FMP symbols remain unchanged.

## V14.12 — 2026-09-23

Synchronized the Global Markets master switch with both public and admin dashboard page visibility lists, so disabling removes the page from both views and enabling restores it to both.

## V14.11 — 2026-09-23

Fixed the Global Markets switch to use an explicit local controlled state and the persisted backend response. Added final provider-call guards before both FMP and Twelve Data requests, and blocked manual FMP testing while Global Markets is disabled.

## V14.10 — 2026-09-23

Fixed Global Markets visibility by adding a lightweight enabled-status endpoint and gating the dashboard tab from that persisted flag. Moved the master switch to the top of the Global Markets admin modal and deferred full quote loading until the section is active.

## V14.09 — 2026-09-23

Aligned Global Markets tables with the compact ADR grid: consistent row spacing, nowrap columns, hover treatment, and a live/closed clock indicator for every instrument.

## V14.08 — 2026-09-23

Fixed toast text visibility with explicit high-contrast title, description, and icon colors. Neutral informational notices no longer use the red error treatment, while OI alerts keep readable red or green semantic text.

## V14.07 — 2026-09-23

Improved toast readability across the app by forcing title, description, and icon colors to inherit the toast semantic color. The guest-access notice is now a neutral informational toast instead of an error-styled notification.

## V14.06 — 2026-09-23

Fixed the Global Markets master switch so disabling it immediately hides the dashboard section and invalidates its cached snapshot. GIFT NIFTY now uses the existing internal Kite-backed ticker feed and is no longer routed through Twelve Data or FMP.

## V14.05 — 2026-09-23

Positioned the Sonner close icon as a small, clearly visible control in the upper-right corner of every toast, with a transparent background and a larger click target.

## V14.04 — 2026-09-23

Added an admin Global Markets master switch that stops provider polling and removes the desk section when disabled. Upgraded maintenance and authentication scenes with animated code/data activity and a market copilot robot. Toast close controls are now small, transparent, square hit targets positioned inside the upper-right corner.

## V14.03 — 2026-09-23

Fixed Financial Modeling Prep polling for selected pairs by batching configured symbols, using provider-specific commodity defaults, retaining per-symbol failures, and throttling the shared FMP request to a six-minute cadence suitable for the common daily request tier. Toast cards now remain white with only their text, icons, borders, and close controls using semantic colors.

## V14.02 — 2026-09-23

Added configurable weekday dashboard defaults, automatic Wednesday/Thursday SENSEX focus, separated ADR and Global Markets provider key sections, standardized toast opacity, and corrected toast close-button containment.

## V14.01 — 2026-09-23

Reworked the unavailable/maintenance screen into a branded brewing scene with animated coffee steam, a coding robot, responsive phone layout, and a clearer retry path.

## V14.00 — 2026-09-23

Added the first-class maintenance/unavailable screen with admin-controlled recovery, responsive API Configuration and Market Memory views, stable Market Intelligence positioning, and light semantic stacked browser alerts.

## V13.01 — 2026-09-23

Browser OI alerts now use the restored stacked desktop surface with light semantic red/green styling, readable direction colors, and close controls. Global Markets includes a dedicated FMP connection test against the current stable quote endpoint.

## V13.00 — 2026-09-23

Desktop OI alerts now retain the earlier multi-toast desk surface, while phone alerts remain in the compact tray with red/green direction styling. Global Markets adds Financial Modeling Prep as a secure per-instrument provider alongside Twelve Data, including encrypted admin key configuration, provider-aware polling, custom instruments, and removal of entries such as TOTAL2.

## V12.01 — 2026-09-22

Global Markets now starts with every instrument disabled and exposes its provider, per-instrument mapping, ADR universe, and whole-category switches only in its dedicated admin-only **Global Markets → Configure** window. Unsupported or plan-gated vendor symbols never appear or consume polling credits until deliberately enabled; turning a category off removes its desk component entirely. Non-ADR categories now use the same dense quote-table treatment as ADR Monitor, and their section layout is drag-reorderable and saved per desk user. Global Market fetch failures are recorded under the distinct `global_market` source rather than ADR. Market Memory is a per-user Desk setting and sits above the OI Change auto-refresh footer when enabled. Straddle now draws both horizontal and vertical gridlines. The automatic API Configuration inventory labels Global Markets and the development checklist documents the source-discovery path for every new provider.

## V12.00 — 2026-09-22

**Global Markets** replaces the ADRs navigation surface while preserving the ADR Monitor within it. A centrally configured Twelve Data registry now normalizes Global Indices, FX, commodities, crypto and macro instruments through the existing shared client/rate limiter, with local exchange clocks and honest unavailable/stale states. **Market Memory** records deterministic touch, rejection and breakout interactions from the existing Kite/OI snapshots, exposes compact desk context, and supplies structured context to Desk AI.

## V11.24 — 2026-09-22

Error Log now hides only noisy external Market Intel source/API failures by default, with a one-click switch to show them; genuine Market Intel application errors remain visible. API Configuration moved from Admin configuration to the Admin Desk tools menu on desktop, tablet, and phone.

## V11.23 — 2026-09-22

Admin Settings now opens an **API Configuration** control-center window. It audits the live backend source for external providers and exact routes, groups each endpoint by module/purpose/code reference, and records safe outbound HTTP telemetry from this version forward. It supports provider/module views, search, filters, drill-down, and handoff to Error Log. ADR page and ADR right panel now share one short-lived client snapshot instead of leaving the second view loading. Admin can also set opacity for the Overnight, Market Intel, and Indicative Price floating panels independently.

## V11.22 — 2026-09-22

Ordinary phone alerts now use a single bottom tray above navigation, leaving the OI desk visible; the Huge OI Shift dialog remains in place with a subtle phone translucency. Admin can set desktop ordinary-alert opacity. The S/L glow threshold now persists correctly and accepts 0.01%–5%; glow shapes remain stable while live OI/spot updates arrive. OI Change no longer transitions its full container on each pull, and ADRs are available in the desktop right-panel picker.

## V11.21 — 2026-09-22

The S/L chart aura now takes a calm eight-second rise-and-fade cycle. Positions status no longer uses boxed badges: **Too close** is clean red text and **OK** clean green text, with enough column room to stay on one line.

## V11.20 — 2026-09-22

The desk now uses a more restrained layered depth across OI Change, Positions, Straddle, Market Intelligence and the Events tiles, while keeping the existing palette. OI Change restores its selected-window red/green wash under that depth. Chart S/L marks have a slow, filled back-origin aura and the Admin-only **S / L glow distance from spot (%)** setting controls which strikes receive it. Phone tabs keep their original selected-pill shape. Market Intel now recalibrates stored headlines to India-index desk grades on refresh, including retained index-constituent relevance.

## V11.19 — 2026-09-22

Admin Market timing now labels the near-ATM position glow markers: red `S` for short and blue `L` for long. Desk panels and interactive Positions / Market Intelligence surfaces have a more visible layered depth treatment, without changing the color palette.

## V11.18 — 2026-09-22

Position contract lines are compact: expiry is no longer repeated in the symbol, and the metadata shows bold, dark `Qty` plus a short date. Near-ATM chart rings are smaller and can now stop at the configured Market close or stay visible after it. Positions and Market Intelligence use restrained surface depth without changing the desk palette. Market Intelligence now shows articles freshly discovered today even when their source publication timestamp is from the prior day.

## V11.17 — 2026-09-22

OI Change and Open Interest now use blue **L** (Long) and red **S** (Short) marks. A mark pulses in its own colour while its strike is within 1% of ATM. The Positions blotter keeps product, quantity, and API-backed expiry below the contract symbol, removes redundant Product/Qty columns, and adds P&L change %. On phones, the Error log table scrolls horizontally so no fields are clipped.

## V11.16 — 2026-09-18

OI B/S badges sit on the centre of each candle and move with the bars (zoom and timeframe). Hover is on the badge: green P&L if profit, red if loss.

## V11.15 — 2026-09-18

Open option B/S marks sit on the matching OI Change / Open Interest candles for the expiry you have open (including next week / next month). Tightening ATM ±N hides marks with those strikes; widening brings them back. Hover (or tap on phone) shows lots and running P&L.

## V11.14 — 2026-09-18

OI Change and Open Interest charts mark open option legs: blue **B** (bought) and red **S** (sold) sit on the matching strike bar and move with it. Shown from the live Positions book when Kite is connected (admin, or guests if Positions is public). Closed legs drop off.

## V11.13 — 2026-09-18

Journal booked P&L is the 15:46 IST print, written to Mongo and frozen. After that the next session is a new day (no leftover rewrite). MCX desks still wait for commodity close + 5 min.

## V11.12 — 2026-09-18

Trade journal on desktop uses nearly the full viewport so the month grid is not clipped. The background journal snapshot keeps writing after OI hours (15:40) and after EOD lock, so booked P&L is stored even when leftover hedges print later. An open-only 0-booked book is not frozen as EOD. Error log is taller.

## V11.11 — 2026-09-18

Unchecking a tracked index only stops polling; Index-management-enabled names stay in Admin alerts, straddle ticks, and chart-signal lot fields. Kite lot size is stored on instrument sync / Enable. Error log is a bit narrower with wrapping, shows stored range, and can purge from the oldest day or flush all. ADR session clock follows listing hours, so a last print after the US close stays red.

## V11.10 — 2026-09-18

Error log fills the viewport and wraps messages so the table does not need a horizontal scrollbar. Market Intel retention and min-history accept 0 (cleanup can wipe stored news). Enabling Gold turns the MCX desk on, uses Kite name GOLD (not GOLDM) and a 200-pt strike step, and the board picks up the name without a full reload. FINNIFTY / MIDCPNIFTY keep their own header and sidebar colours. Admin alerts, data collection, and chart-signal lots only list Index-management-enabled names. Header index tiles switch the desk on click.

## V11.09 — 2026-09-17

Phone dashboard keeps page tabs while scrolling so you can scroll back up. NIFTY/SENSEX mobile tiles show IEP in-tile. Market Intel popup is a fixed height. Events page ticks are admin-configurable again; the four info tiles stay on. News below impact 50 is not stored; same-story duplicates are dropped; heavy index constituents boost ingest. Tata Motors ADR quotes TATAY (OTC). Straddle history prefetches in the background.

## V11.08 — 2026-09-17

Market Intel timeouts no longer pretend to be a Kite dump; GET `/market-intel` filters Mongo to the selected IST day so the feed can return before the client aborts. Events (holidays, economic calendar, index impact) stay public even when Index Risk is unticked. ADR quotes follow Twelve Data Basic 8 (8 credits/min, one symbol per call, 7.5s spacing, 90s backoff on 429) and keep the last good prints.

## V11.07 — 2026-09-17

Reload no longer flashes every dashboard tab before `/config` — guests only see enabled pages, home is OI Change. Phone ADRs: quotes first (Last, Change, Chg. %), coverage tiles behind an arrow, tap a name for the full sheet.

## V11.06 — 2026-09-17

CAS IEP UI hides when Kite settles (cash close 15:30 IST, or when Quote sends 0). Sidebar and popup show IEP change % vs previous close. ATM stays on LTP during the auction and snaps to the IEP strike after settle. ADRs use SVG USA/Germany flags (not “US” letters) and a nameless last-column clock with Market open / Market closed hover.

## V11.05 — 2026-09-17

ADRs: Last updated column (timestamp only), listing-country flags, Market Status text kept plus a red/green session clock. German (XETRA/FRA) Indian names are allowed and polled in Frankfurt hours. Indicative price stays on sparse WS ticks; sidebar label is Indicative price with a bold print. CAS dock popup shows NIFTY 50 + SENSEX from 15:19 IST through IEP end; Admin dropdown toggles it.

## V11.04 — 2026-09-17

ADRs page imports `formatIstStamp` (and `formatAdrCell` / `ADR_FILTERS`) from `@/lib/adr`.

## V11.03 — 2026-09-17

ADR page imports `ADR_COLUMNS`. Market Intel JSX parses. Live-strip quotes: one space name–price–%, wider gap between names, slower marquee.

## V11.02 — 2026-09-17

Live strip no longer crashes (`useEffect` import). Index LTP on the existing spot WebSocket ticks every 1s in session; quote width is fixed so the marquee does not jump. Admin dialogs only scroll vertically; close X is square-aligned. ADR universe actions are icons. Market Intel keeps the last feed on screen while the next date loads and caches so leaving for Positions and returning is instant.

## V11.01 — 2026-09-17

Admin can tick ADRs on Public/Admin dashboard pages (`adrs` is an allowed page key). Journal is a fixed desktop size; LIVE + Next Pull stay left while quotes marquee. Admin configuration is tiles. IEP preview-now, radar book tape, Positions column drag.

## V11.00 — 2026-09-17

Indian ADR desk tab: Twelve Data quotes (USD) for a seeded Indian ADR universe, admin-configurable. Backend-only polling (5m during the NYSE session, one 09:15 IST refresh). Column picker is a per-user preference. Large ADR / banking moves feed Market Intelligence and the existing Alerts list, deduped per session. API key is Fernet-vaulted and never returned to the browser.

## V10.14 — 2026-09-17

Telegram token and chat ID live in Admin → Telegram (Fernet vault + BotFather help), not Admin configuration. Market Intel chip stays one line on the right with unseen CRITICAL count; popup is on by default and after 14:00 IST includes the prior session until the next open. Error log Src chips come from stored sources. Live strip is one RTL CSS marquee (LIVE + Next Pull + quotes). VIX uses the same portal hover as GIFT. Journal Previous/Next skip weekends and holidays. CAS IEP Quote window is admin-configurable (default 15:20–15:35 IST, 5s).

## V10.13 — 2026-09-17

Telegram bot token and chat ID live in Admin → Admin configuration (same `telegram_prefs` document as alert filters). Token is Fernet-encrypted and never returned in plaintext. Market status is display-open (09:15) vs OI poll (09:14): live label is `Market Open · Next Pull (Xs)`. Pre-market 09:00–09:15 and CAS IEP 15:20–15:35 use Kite Quote `indicative_close_price` without overwriting LTP. Header index tiles are rounded rectangles. VIX hover explains volatility.

## V10.12 — 2026-09-17

Trade journal EOD first-write no longer fails Mongo `$set` / `$setOnInsert` on `eod_locked` (days after 15:45 were silently dropped). Market Intelligence `GET /api/market-intel?filter=&date=` validates YYYY-MM-DD, returns 400 on bad dates, and serializes feed items safely; empty days are 200 with `items: []`; UI distinguishes load error vs empty. Admin Error log shows a persisted unseen-count badge. Straddle hides next-refresh and stops live poll after market close.

## V10.11 — 2026-09-16

OI Change tooltip stacks above Bias/PCR tiles and the Increase/Decrease legend. Session bias bar stays sticky at the top of the dashboard scroller (all tabs, phone included). ATM ± N recenters on live ATM as spot moves. Header Today P&L and Overnight/Desk AI book fetches are admin-only so a public desk does not show our trades.

## V10.10 — 2026-09-15

Mkt Intel and Overnight docks cannot sit under the ticker / Kite API header. Dragging them up keeps the handle on screen so they stay movable. Overnight sits above the header stacking order.

## V10.09 — 2026-09-15

Market Intelligence tab no longer vanishes after a few seconds (user `page_enabled` pref no longer hides the page). RSS `pubDate` values are parsed so today’s stories show and stay in Mongo `mi_articles` for the retention-days setting. Popup on/off reloads immediately; clicking the Mkt Intel chip no longer unmounts it. Positions **Warn @** sits on the Kite Positions / Unhedged Exposure row, far right.

## V10.08 — 2026-09-15

Phone Admin configuration and Mkt Intel settings open as a real sheet (tools scrim no longer covers the dialog). Mkt Intel settings scroll inside the viewport. Event types on the Market Intelligence page render as bold caps (`INDIA MACRO`, `OIL`). After Kite login, Positions force-refreshes the book instead of waiting for a full app reload.

## V10.07 — 2026-09-15

Restored the original dialog overlay (Journal, Analyze, Admin configuration). Journal/Analyze sit above the dimmer so they are clickable. Mkt Intel close docks to a chip until the next session (configurable in Mkt Intel settings). Desk AI coach no longer warns on duplicate list keys.

## V10.06 — 2026-09-15

Phone Admin configuration is forced into the screen (12px inset, above the tools bar) so it is not a blank dim overlay. Market Intel page and popup show **today’s** stories only. The popup lists today’s critical count and always has left/right arrows to step through them.

## V10.05 — 2026-09-15

Phone Admin configuration (and other dialogs) sit in the viewport above the header instead of a dark overlay with no sheet. Unhedged Exposure wraps on Positions. Market Intel news docks like Overnight: drag, close to a **Mkt Intel** chip until the next session, left/right arrows on the sheet.

## V10.04 — 2026-09-15

Market Intelligence popup: left/right arrows when several high-impact stories are waiting; labels read **Impact 96** and **Indian market impact 70**. Desk ingest keeps pulling and storing even if the page or popups are off. The admin “Allow in-app popups” tick is the only desk-wide popup kill switch (off = nobody; on = admin always sees it). Admin tools, journal, and settings dialogs fit a phone.

## V10.03 — 2026-09-15

Index chips: a normal trending-down day is **BEAR TREND**; RISK-OFF only for crash-size drops. Market Intelligence shows the impact score in a box beside CRITICAL/HIGH/MODERATE. Hedge popover states leftover **shorts vs longs** (lots) per CE/PE.

## V10.02 — 2026-09-15

Index chips classify the **session** (open → path → high/low → now), not just red vs previous close. RISK-OFF is reserved for strong downside continuation. Strike Pressure uses multi-window distance, session location, and option LTP as confirmation so a move toward a strike is not stuck on NEUTRAL. Positions Analyze adds a Summary/Greeks column.

## V10.01 — 2026-09-15

Desk AI keys and Market Intelligence settings are their own Admin-menu dialogs (like Kite login), not stuffed into Admin configuration. Active requires a vaulted key (or env `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI). Public market-news RSS is seeded on by default; keyed catalog APIs stay ticked but wait for a key. Positions Live table adds **Strike Pressure** (toward/away vs position impact). Hedge leftover uses lots, not L.

## V10.00 — 2026-09-15

**Market Intelligence** is a new dashboard page (Public/Admin ticks, side panel, phone dock). Admin adds RSS/API/Firecrawl/official feeds without a deploy; ingest starts ~90s after boot then on a configurable interval (default 5 minutes). News is scored for market impact and India relevance, clustered, ranked, and retained on a rolling calendar-day window (default 5, min history 2). Users set page/popup prefs; very-high-impact in-app popups are top-2 only and once per event cluster.

**Desk AI keys** live in Admin configuration: pick OpenAI / DeepSeek / Grok / Groq / OpenRouter or add any OpenAI-compatible base URL and vault the key (env `OPENAI_API_KEY` remains fallback).

## V9.18 — 2026-09-15

Positions shows a compact **Hedge status** next to open/exited counts. Open option lots are grouped by underlying + CE/PE from the book (any index, no catalog). BUY vs SELL remaining quantity is converted with each contract’s Kite `lot_size`. Fully offset groups read as hedged; leftover long or short lots are underhedged or unhedged. Click the chip for the breakdown.

## V9.17 — 2026-09-02

CAS 15:20 shows homepage **Indicative Close** (not leftover `closingValue` like 23,917 vs 23,914). Streaming last and previous close are on the same strip. Live is select-then-**Start**. Fetch uses `getIndexData` first with a short timeout. Admin recap states freeze vs indicative and why CE or PE.

## V9.16 — 2026-09-02

CAS Auto Trade 15:20 now uses the nseindia.com **Indicative Close** (`getIndexData?type=ALL` / `allIndices` field `indicativeClose` only). Do not use cash `last`, and do not call getIndexData with `index=NIFTY 50` (that zeros the field). Leftover `marketStatus` CLOSE / previous close stay ignored. Live still needs the **backend** IP on the Kite developer allowlist.

## V9.15 — 2026-09-02

CAS Auto Trade **Paper** is WATCHING as soon as you switch it on: NSE cookies and ATM preview load before 15:20, then the same freeze / first-print / DRY-BUY path as Live (no Zerodha fill). Paper fires are stored in a test log on the CAS page.

## V9.14 — 2026-09-02

Positions day-loss circuit: −3% caution, −5% stop new shorts, −8% capital event. Funds leftover is not treated as dry powder. Desk AI **What to do** is full-width and capital-first; sell ideas and “prefer CE shorts” hide on a stop/event day. Brains verdict overrides a GOOD book score after a capital hit.

## V9.13 — 2026-09-02

Journal no longer copies yesterday’s booked P&L onto the new calendar date after midnight. Snapshots use the last session until the next open (same rule as OI). Opening the journal deletes that clone if it already landed.

## V9.12 — 2026-09-02

Paper Auto Trade shows **NSE live** (first pull + later changes) vs the **fire print**, keeps probing after EXECUTED, and explains leave-Paper-on / inject. CAS `/cas/status` no longer re-hits ipify on every failed lookup (that caused 12s timeouts). Header index tiles use a small regime chip; OI bias bar is a compact label, not a pink wash.

## V9.11 — 2026-09-02

CAS Auto Trade Paper probes NSE JSON in cash hours and writes scrape errors, skip reasons, and the fire recap (when, how, DRY-BUY id, latency) into the strip under the cards — so you can confirm the tape before Live.

## V9.10 — 2026-09-01

CAS Auto Trade **Paper** is a live-session dry-run: real Kite NIFTY freeze and real NSE first print, `DRY-BUY` only (no account fill). Inject before 15:20 is a rehearsal that does not spend the day’s fire. Classic Activate is still not required for this arm.

## V9.09 — 2026-09-01

Index regime chips use net % vs previous close **and** the day’s high–low: **Ranging** when the band is wider than the net move (chop), **Quiet** when both are small, **Trend / Bullish / Risk-off** when the session is one-way. Tooltips show the numbers. CAS page splits **15:20 Auto Trade** (own lots, BUY one) from **15:28 Expiry** (own lots, SELL both).

## V9.08 — 2026-09-01

CAS Auto Trade 15:20 has a full operator manual: [docs/CAS_AUTO_TRADE_15_20.md](docs/CAS_AUTO_TRADE_15_20.md) (two CAS arms, clocks, what admin does, first-print rules, CE/PE math, Live vs Paper).

## V9.07 — 2026-09-01

Overnight the desk kept hitting `/oi/*/change` and `/expiries` like a live session: weekday after-hours was not treated as closed unless `/status` had already said so, and an empty expiry list was re-fetched every poll (that flickered “No expiries yet”). CAS status slows to 60s after hours. Saving Kite credentials before Mongo/OI is up returns 503 instead of `set_credentials` on None.

## V9.06 — 2026-09-01

CAS Auto Trade reads both `indexLast` and `closingValue` on the NSE widget: if live NIFTY is still the freeze print, a stamped 15:20 `closingValue` can still fire the CE/PE buy. Unstamped `closingValue` is ignored (yesterday’s close). Desk crash reports skip credentialed `sendBeacon` when the API is another origin (CORS `*`).

## V9.05 — 2026-09-01

CAS Expiry no longer crashes (`nowMs` was missing). Regime Info icons sit **beside** index ticker buttons so HTML is not button-in-button.

## V9.04 — 2026-09-01

CAS page compiles again: leftover duplicate alerts after the Auto Trade block had an extra `</div>` that Babel read as an unclosed fragment. Header index regime no longer treats a missing LTP as price 0 (that looked like a 100% crash).

## V9.03 — 2026-09-01

CAS Auto Trade will not treat the frozen live NIFTY print as the 15:20 indicative (that would have locked NO_TRADE before +27 printed). Prepare retries if Kite blips; the engine stays on a 200ms loop when Auto Trade is on even without classic Activate; MARKET BUY still uses Kite `order_type=MARKET` + `market_protection=-1`. Brains path risk stays the short book (calls = upside, puts = downside), not a fake index regime.

## V9.02 — 2026-09-01

CAS **Auto Trade** (separate from the 15:28 sell-both arm): freeze live NIFTY just before 15:20, lock that ATM, poll NSE `GET /api/marketStatus` for Indicative NIFTY 50, and place **one MARKET BUY** of ATM CE or PE if the first sane print is ±15 pts vs freeze. You exit in Positions. Paper by default. Overnight CLOSE leftovers are ignored. Do not run Auto-Trade Live together with classic CAS Live.

## V9.01 — 2026-09-01

Positions **Brains** now scores the live short book instead of a canned heat story. Heat comes from too-close / ITM / near-expiry / concentration / net delta / negative theta — not from `|θ|` or a 15% “danger” band that flagged every typical short. If/then uses your nearest short put and call, not placeholder 24,000 / 24,500. Short calls are upside risk; short puts are downside. Info icons pin a portaled tip and no longer close the Brains or Radar sheet.

## V9.00 — 2026-09-01

Position Brain now reads as a real decision system rather than a generic data dump: the main verdict leads with urgency, confidence, the reason it matters, and the best action to take next; the side panel also explains why the portfolio is heating, how the best and worst positions compare, and where data quality is still limiting the call.

The compact desk tile layout was tightened into a cleaner single-row system, stale withdrawal-copy messaging was hidden behind the future Kite-led data path, and event tiles were tightened so they fit without crowding the dashboard.

## V8.15 — 2026-08-25

Positions tiles stay one line: **Profit booked** (no “today”) shows rupees; % of wallet sits in the hint. Funds available is Kite leftover only — the 72L “total book” (cash + SPAN on hedges) is not shown and is not the % base. Duplicate commodity cash is not added on top of equity.

## V8.14 — 2026-08-25

Day % is **wallet after charges**, not SPAN on a leveraged/hedged book. Wallet is Kite opening cash + collateral (e.g. ~36.25L), never leftover margin + utilised (that was showing ~72L). Example: ₹15L in the account, ₹25L notional via leverage, ₹1,500 booked after ₹200 charges → **0.10%**. A previous leftover+SPAN freeze is replaced on the next snapshot.

## V8.13 — 2026-08-25

Journal and Positions treat trading as a **% of total book**, not leftover cash. Day % is booked P&L ÷ that morning’s total funds (available margin + money already in trades). Weekly and monthly % use the first stored total book of that week/month. Kite Connect has no withdrawal API; estimated in/out is the gap vs the prior close (overnight MTM included). Positions **Profit booked today** shows the same % against total book, never Funds available.

## V8.12 — 2026-08-25

ATM label no longer clips on the OI bars. Inactive indexes (SENSEX) show day move without clicking them. Show OI sits under How to read this. Replay Change auto-plays from the open of the window. Switching timeframes animates the bars. Around ATM defaults to ±5. Admin tools dim the desk behind an emerald-tinted panel. Mobile event tiles stay compact.

## V8.11 — 2026-08-25

App-wide error log: uncaught API exceptions, `logger.exception`, and desk UI crashes go to Mongo `error_logs` (tokens stripped). Admin menu **Error log**. Websocket cancel still closes quietly and does not swallow KeyboardInterrupt.

## V8.10 — 2026-08-25

Straddle and spot websockets treat reload / tab-close `CancelledError` as a normal disconnect instead of an ASGI crash. Ctrl+C while uvicorn is respawning can still print a KeyboardInterrupt — that is the process stopping, not a desk bug.

## V8.09 — 2026-08-25

W/M expiry circles are back on the sidebar. 25 Aug NIFTY still tags **M** (last Tuesday); SENSEX monthly is last Thursday.

## V8.08 — 2026-08-25

Monthly vs weekly expiry uses the exchange calendar (NSE last Tuesday, SENSEX last Thursday) instead of “last date in the list”. 25 Aug 2026 NIFTY is monthly; SENSEX monthly is 27 Aug. Journal no longer lists a contract tape (Excel download still has the book). Closed Kite rows are not re-seeded every poll.

## V8.07 — 2026-08-25

NIFTY expiries no longer stick on today’s weekly after the first OI paint. Heavyweight cash quotes retry in chunks (one bad symbol no longer blanks the tape). Browser alerts use a timed service-worker call and a page Notification fallback so they still fire when you are in another tab. Journal shows the stored trade tape (contract, sold/bought, IST clocks, P&L); Excel leads with that sheet.

## V8.06 — 2026-08-24

Desk AI names the shorts: Hold / Cut/define / Roll by tradingsymbol vs the writer tape. Positions radar says which leg to buy back, roll, or hedge. Closed-short win rates from the trade ledger (`GET /api/desk-memory`) feed a Book memory line. Coach explains the top 3 sell-ranker ideas — it does not invent a list. OI alerts add writer-tape actions (do not add the other side). Snapshots stay compact: no tokens or full chains.

## V8.05 — 2026-08-24

Desk AI was collapsing to a session-focus headline. The strip now shows OI tape (writers, PCR, walls), the open book (Δ / Θ / IV), last-30d journal, cash heavyweights, and a **Do / Don't** coach. Overnight hold uses the same stack plus VIX, GIFT, events, and greeks for hold/cut/don't-add lines.

## V8.04 — 2026-08-24

Desk AI matches the OI Change bar: call-writer tape supports **CE shorts**, put-writer tape supports **PE shorts**. Overnight hold now scores NIFTY, SENSEX, and BANKNIFTY (Mon–Tue / Fri NIFTY focus, Wed–Thu SENSEX). Heavyweights are NIFTY + BANKNIFTY cash only. Download trades lives in the journal (popover sits above the modal); it is gone from Positions.

## V8.03 — 2026-08-24

Chrome OS banners when the desk is on another screen: we no longer mark desktop notifications as `silent`, we fire them when the tab is hidden or unfocused, and a tiny service worker (`sw-alerts.js`) uses `showNotification` so Chrome actually paints the sidebar. Turning notifications on sends a test banner. In-app toasts still cover the focused tab.

## V8.02 — 2026-08-24

Desk chrome: trading-terminal focus rings, pointer cursor on controls, denser timeframe pills (JetBrains Mono), crisper header glass, 44px-class tile toggles on phone, and `prefers-reduced-motion` respected globally. Light Swiss desk is unchanged — no OLED restyle.

## V8.01 — 2026-08-24

Partials are stored as their own rows: time, qty exited **this** fill, remaining qty, and realised for that slice (Excel **Partials** sheet). A Friday hold that is scaled out twice on Monday keeps Friday’s entry clock.

## V8.00 — 2026-08-24

Trade ledger: every Positions poll stores open / partial / closed cycles in Mongo (`trade_cycles`). **Download trades** (Positions toolbar + journal) exports an Excel for any From/To filter.

- Entry time is the original fill (or first seen). A Friday hold that is still open on Monday after a new Kite token is the same cycle — not a new purchase.
- Exit time is the flatten fill (or inferred only if the leg vanished while the token was stale).
- Partial exits are extra events on that cycle (second Excel sheet).
- Stale token: we freeze clocks and do not close or reopen trades until Kite is back.

## V7.18 — 2026-08-20

Phone OI Change: strike tile is translucent, only while you hold a bar, and hides as soon as the finger moves or lifts. Strike labels on the X-axis are no longer clipped. Positions: NRML and CALL/PUT stay on one line; less gap after Exited today. Journal From/To dates stack cleanly on phone.

## V7.17 — 2026-08-19

OI Change window keeps exact seconds (10:12:47–10:27:47 for 15 min). Background poller writes every Admin interval for all enabled indices with no browser open — ticks are not snapped to :00/:15/:30.

## V7.16 — 2026-08-19

OI Change Last N mins is now−N through now, sliding every poll. It does not wait to “warm up” 15 minutes after a refresh.

- Baseline is the snapshot at or before now−N (today’s 09:15 floor). 10:29:45 + 15 min → ~10:14:45–10:29:45; next poll at 10:30 → ~10:15–10:30
- Dropped the 80% window warmup that kept the blue “Full compare in …” banner

## V7.15 — 2026-08-19

Poll intervals are read from Admin configuration in Mongo. The straddle chart bucket and “live Ns” label use that saved value (60s stays 60s).

- GET /config and the sampler re-read oi / straddle / positions seconds from `settings` `_id: alerts`
- Saving configuration clears the frontend /config cache so an old 15s payload cannot overwrite 60s
- Positions book default matches the form (30s) until that document loads

## V7.14 — 2026-08-19

Straddle (and other) poll intervals follow Admin configuration. 60s is 60s — not silently capped at 15s in the chart or 30s in the sampler.

- Chart REST poll, countdown, sampler, tick cache, and WS use `straddle_poll_interval_seconds`
- Checklist: before hardcoding a number, check whether Admin already has that setting

## V7.13 — 2026-08-19

LIVE rail, straddle, and Positions show countdown to the next poll. Straddle last price sits above the end dot. Past NSE holidays collapse. CALL/PUT chips sit beside NRML when the screen allows.

- Status copy is `next (11s)` instead of `Updated 4s ago` / last-refresh clock
- Straddle premium label is above the last tick (not clipped on the right)
- Events: completed holidays start collapsed
- Positions: NRML + CALL/PUT stack on a tight screen, sit in one row from `sm` up

## V7.12 — 2026-08-19

OI Change paints as soon as a poll lands — any enabled index, no timeframe click.

- Live poll no longer waits on the other indices before the next refresh.
- `/change` takes a newer Mongo tick when in-memory cache is stale (open session included).

## V7.11 — 2026-08-18

Phone status bar shows only the moving indexes (no LAST SESSION, date, or Market Closed). Page titles use the desk mark. Analyze adds ±0.5%. Journal layout fits tablet. Sign out is red. Event tile menus stay short on phone.

- Closed-session rail on phone: ticker only; LAST SESSION / session date / Market Closed stay on tablet and desktop
- Page mark (same as Kite Positions) on Straddle Premium, OI Change, Open Interest, Strike Table, Sell Candidates, Build-up, Alerts, Activity, Events, CAS — not Index Risk
- Analyze spot presets include −0.5% and +0.5%
- Holiday / FII / Events / Impact dropdowns clamp to the viewport so they do not cover the phone chart
- Trade journal is full-screen through tablet (`lg`); compact calendar until desktop; date fields and stats grid align
- Admin Sign out is rose red

## V7.10 — 2026-08-18

Journal money on phone uses short rounded labels (₹47.5k) so calendar tiles fit; desktop still shows exact paisa.

## V7.09 — 2026-08-18

Trade journal stays in sync after close, shows exact rupees, and adds a from–to totals strip. Closed-session rail is LAST SESSION + date + Market Closed at last snapshot.

- Same-day journal P&L can revise after EOD lock (leftover expiry hedges). Opening a day re-snapshots Positions.
- Journal money uses paisa (no ₹2.2k / lakhs rounding). From–to panel: exact booked profit, charges, win %, index filter (NIFTY / SENSEX / BANKNIFTY).
- Slim bar: yellow LAST SESSION, session date, moon **Market Closed at** last snap. Dropped “for the day”, “Closed 15:40”, and “snap 15:40”.
- Index ticker loops: what scrolls off one side comes back on the other.

## V7.08 — 2026-08-18

Book leftover 0.05 expiry hedges after the cash session so Profit booked and the journal match Today P&L.

- After admin market close + 5 minutes, open CE/PE with expiry today (or earlier) at ₹0.05 are marked closed in our book (no Kite order). Zerodha already RMS-squares them; Connect often still shows net qty until T+1.
- Manual **Square leftovers in book** on Positions after close if you want it before 15:45.
- Journal EOD lock uses the same booked total (your ~₹47.5k, not the inflated booked column).
- LAST SESSION rail: yellow pill + date/time, then moon **Markets closed for the day**. Dropped the duplicate “Market closed · OI paused · GIFT/VIX” line.
- India VIX poll window is 09:15–15:40 IST (not after hours).

Kite forum (settlement vs LTP on leftover expiry): realised P&L uses settlement, not lastPrice.


## V7.07 — 2026-08-18

Keep the desk answering while Kite and Mongo catch up. Admin 15s poll / extra indices must not freeze Loading.

- HTTP binds after Mongo ping; index builds and Kite dump run in the background
- OI poller no longer waits on `kite.instruments()`; dump is fire-and-forget
- GET `/oi`, straddle, and VRP use cache until the dump is in memory (no dump on the event loop)
- Dashboard settings poll uses `/config` (no Mongo reload). Admin configuration uses `?reload=1`
- 15s OI interval is floored to 30s until instruments are loaded
- Auth gate fail-opens after 1.5s if `/auth/state` never returns


## V7.06 — 2026-08-18

Unstick the origin: the daily Kite instrument dump no longer runs on the FastAPI event loop.

- Poller `ensure_instruments_fresh` loads instruments in a thread (was blocking every `/api/*` for 20s+)
- `/oi/.../change` Mongo lookbacks are wait_for 3s; first snapshot read is 2s
- Default Axios timeout 12s; `/expiries` 8s; one shared `/config` for Dashboard + clocks
- Index-events tile waits 8s after paint so it is not in the boot stampede

## V7.05 — 2026-08-18

Stop the dark “Loading…” screen when the origin hangs (preview /auth/state 0-byte stall).

- Auth gate fetches `/auth/state` first with a 2.8s cap; Remember-me runs after paint
- `/auth/state` returns immediately if Mongo is not up; settings/session reads are time-capped
- Kite `positions()` / `quote()` on GET `/positions` wait at most 10s / 8s so they cannot pin the worker forever

## V7.04 — 2026-08-18

Positions tiles are a horizontal scroller again. Booked P&L includes Kite Booked on still-open partials.

- Insight tiles row scrolls sideways (not a 2×4 wrap)
- Kite Connect often puts the whole MTM in `unrealised` with `realised` at 0; we no longer treat that as Booked ₹0
- Open legs that were bought/sold today use matched buy/sell for Booked, same as the Kite Booked column
- Unbooked = Total P&L − Booked (Kite Unbooked)

## V7.03 — 2026-08-18

Restore the full huge-OI-shift card and match Kite Booked / Unbooked / Total P&L.

- Big OI move modal again shows ATM, spot, time, Δ Call/Put OI per strike, and larger tiles (not three tiny chips)
- Positions insight tiles wrap in a 2×4 grid with readable numbers
- Profit booked today uses Kite `realised` (or kite P&L minus unrealised), not buy/sell averages or live LTP
- Today P&L hint is Unbooked + Booked, the same split as Kite Positions

## V7.02 — 2026-08-18

Quiet the false Bank Nifty toast, keep booked profit still, and use the pulse mark on the home screen.

- Disabled indices on the quote strip no longer toast on hover (scrolling was firing “BANK NIFTY is on the quote strip…”)
- Positions “too close” strip only shows when shorts are actually inside the warn band
- Profit booked today no longer moves with live LTP (closed cash only)
- Kite Positions uses the pulse mark; home-screen icon is the same pulse, sharper, with a very thin white rim
- GET `/config` and the OI poller no longer wait on Mongo; a stuck DB cannot freeze every `/api/*` call
- First OI `/change` is one lookback (20s budget); 1/3/5 windows fill 2.5s later so the rest of the desk is not queued behind it

## V7.01 — 2026-08-18

Admin configuration reads the saved Mongo document every time you open it; Positions auto-refresh uses that value.

- Opening Admin configuration always reloads settings from the database (not a stale API-worker copy that still showed 30s)
- Positions auto-refresh (seconds) is saved and applied to the live book poller and header P&L
- OI / straddle / pages / hours / desk flags apply from the same saved document

## V7.00 — 2026-08-18

Desk V7: one OI toast with the full read, a visible LIVE pulse, and a cleaner phone header.

- OI toasts keep **Puts adding — bullish** and add Put/Call selling plus PE/CE crores on the same card
- LIVE tile pulse is emerald (readable on the white badge)
- Phone status rail hides **Market open · Updated Ns** so VIX/GIFT/indices keep the row
- Header uses Outfit; ticker labels are a bit larger and less mono
- First OI fetch still includes 1/3/5 windows so huge-shift can fire on the first tick
- Sell / decay ideas stay live until **market close IST on expiry day** (not ~4h before close)
- Position heatmap uses desk green/red fills; P&L border (not a red ring on every “too close” tile)
- Side-panel OI Change uses the same OI-on/off chart as the main tab
- Header Today P&L and Positions Today P&L share one book snapshot (they no longer drift by a few tens of rupees)
- Open live legs keep GET /positions running on every dashboard page while the cash session is live

## V6.45 — 2026-08-18

Desk paints in seconds: auth no longer blocks on a jammed API, and startup loads the active index first.

- Returning admin/guest sessions skip the full-screen Loading wait and refresh auth in the background
- First OI pull is the open tab only (other indices + huge-shift windows fill a few seconds later)
- Alerts, tickers, VIX extras, VRP, and settings no longer fire at the same instant as the first chart
- `/oi/.../change` lookbacks run in parallel with a 4s Mongo cap so one slow query cannot stall the origin
- Alert beep `data:` audio is allowed by CSP (`media-src`)
- Positions **Funds available** is Kite Available margin (`equity.net` ≈ cash + collateral), not the debit Available cash figure

## V6.44 — 2026-08-18

Positions Refresh fetches a full book; desk charts stay centered; admin tools reorder.

- Refresh on Positions always pulls the latest book (polls stay quiet once the table is on screen)
- OI last pulled sits under the OI card; bias, tabs, and Events share the same centered width as the charts
- LIVE is a white tile; ticker has a gap after Market open / Updated
- Straddle stats wrap instead of clipping; green Settings sits at the far right
- Admin tools: config through CSV above Public; Sign out last; click outside closes
- Disabled-index toast says Bank Nifty (not BNF) and drops the Index management line

## V6.43 — 2026-08-18

Phone OI charts default to ±5 strikes; alerts close and sound on iOS.

- OI Change and Open Interest default to ATM ±5 (phone and desktop); phone chart is shorter with upright strike labels
- One toast at a time, below the header; huge-shift uses a short closable card (not a toast stuck under a dialog)
- OI Change toasts use short copy (Puts/Calls adding or up/down %)
- Phone alert sound: keep Web Audio unlocked on tap; iOS plays an HTML beep (Silent Mode still mutes unless the ringer is on)

## V6.42 — 2026-08-18

Open-leg P&L marks to live quotes; OI + Open Interest stay centered when panes close.

- Positions re-quote open F&O LTPs and recompute MTM (Kite `positions().pnl` was lagging)
- Open Interest uses the same max-width card as OI Change when both side panes are closed
- Disabled BNF hover toasts instead of the forbidden cursor
- Long weekend: Friday holiday (Fri–Sun) and Monday holiday (Sat–Mon)
- Phone / Home Screen icon is the rounded desk mark, not a hard full square

## V6.41 — 2026-08-18

Brokerage counted per order; LIVE status sits next to the pill; Positions refresh.

- Day charges use one Kite contract-note row per executed order (split fills were each billed ₹20)
- LIVE rail: pulsing dot + LIVE, then Market open / Updated, then the ticker
- Positions poll every interval during the session; Refresh is never stuck disabled
- Disabled index tiles stay full colour, not clickable, hover explains they are off the desk
- Home Screen: prompt to enable notifications; icon is `any` (no maskable cutout glow)
- OI Change wash is lighter and the card is centered when both side panes are closed

## V6.40 — 2026-08-18

Kite callback on striklenz.com; desk sounds; slim status; full-bleed icon.

- Kite login bounce ignores retired aaisnamkeen.com and completes on striklenz.com (`/kite-callback` is not behind AuthGate)
- Notifications can be turned **off**; alert sounds unlock Web Audio (missing `playForAlert` import was silencing them)
- Background tab: one summary toast instead of a pile; huge-shift modals do not stack 7–8 deep
- Always one slim top status rail (scrolls); MARKETS LIVE no longer duplicates in the header; disabled indices are not clickable in the header
- Admin configuration applies on save immediately (no expiry re-seed unless enabled indices changed)
- Home-screen icon is full-bleed green with a pulse glow on the in-app mark

## V6.39 — 2026-08-17

Show Kite overnight maintenance on Positions; slimmer phone chrome.

- Empty Kite book before 7:00 IST keeps the maintenance banner (same idea as Kite’s toaster)
- Next Holiday tile flags Fri/Mon holidays as a long weekend (extra theta)
- Phone: shorter day-bias bar; tabs/Events hide on scroll; selected index stays as a slim price chip
- Home Screen icon uses opaque 512 + dark splash so iOS adds less white padding

## V6.38 — 2026-08-17

MCX poll load cap; keep OI and live Positions warm in the background; LIVE ticker on desktop.

- Poller runs at most 2 Kite snapshots at once (MCX on no longer floods CPU)
- OI `/change` warms every enabled index after the active one so Sensex is not stale on switch
- Positions keep polling in other tabs only while there are live (non-zero qty) legs
- LIVE rail marquee shows all enabled indices on desktop too

## V6.37 — 2026-08-17

Phone chrome and Positions layout; MCX Gold quotes use the listed strike grid.

- Sticky index row no longer repeats Today P&amp;L (header chip stays)
- Positions: insight tiles swipe left/right again; Columns is a compact popover; closed-Chrome alert copy lives on Alerts / Telegram
- Your book can be dragged (or placed) above the list, after Live, or below the list — kept in this browser
- OI Change “Alert on ≥ %” is a small bell on the ATM strip
- GOLD / SILVER / CRUDEOIL quotes skip minis; snapshot ATM uses listed MCX strikes (not a wrong catalog step)

## V6.36 — 2026-08-17

MCX desk toggle, clearer book tilt, collapsible Your book, guest holiday reminder, tighter event joins.

- Admin **MCX** switch in Index management and Settings. Off = no commodity poll/UI. On = Enable Gold/Crude/etc.; only those names pull OI
- Your book collapses by default; Move above/below the position list. Net Δ says **bullish** or **bearish**, not “one way”
- Guests see a holiday-calendar reminder from **20 Dec** until Admin uploads next year’s NSE circular
- Index Risk join: longer company-name matches; coverage line shows how many Nifty / Bank Nifty / Sensex names hit the events file

## V6.35 — 2026-08-17

Positions phone polish, always-on CALL/PUT, and an uploadable NSE holiday circular.

- Phone insight tiles are a 2-column equal-height grid (no huge P&amp;L / funds cards). Book score sits above the cards; Insights opens on first phone visit
- Position cards always show CALL or PUT beside NRML, even when the name is fully visible
- Admin Upload → **NSE holiday circular** (CSV/XLSX). Years in the file overlay the built-in list. Next Holiday / poll hours use the merge
- Closed-Chrome phone alerts: Telegram is the reliable path (documented on Positions + Telegram prefs). Browser banners still need the tab open

## V6.34 — 2026-08-17

Phone Positions: Today P&L stays in the header; CE/PE sits beside NRML when the name truncates.

- Compact P&L chip on the phone header and sticky index row (admin, or guest when Positions is public)
- Phone position cards show a CE or PE badge next to NRML so the side is visible when the title ends in “…”

## V6.33 — 2026-08-16

The desk is branded **StrikLenz**. The display name is one line in repo-root `APP_NAME`.

- Header, login, About, tab title, PWA name, API `/version`, Telegram session wrap, and current docs use that name
- To rename later: edit `APP_NAME`, rebuild the UI. Do not change Mongo `DB_NAME` or the login token salt

## V6.32 — 2026-08-16

Guest approval is optional. Hosting path is Atlas + one always-on VM (not Vercel for the API).

- Public menu: **Require approval** toggle (default ON). When OFF, a guest full name is stored and they enter immediately; blocked IPs still cannot
- Access Control still lists names. Public OFF still signs guests out
- HOSTING.md: UI/API/DB comparison — Atlas + Linux VM + Caddy; Vercel is not for the Kite poller

## V6.31 — 2026-08-15

Index Impact and Upcoming Index Event Risk show the same upcoming constituent calendar.

- Tile lists every upcoming joined event (not only results / board meetings), sorted by days then weight
- Empty tile opens an in-place list (does not jump tabs). Past-only calendars say the file is dated before today
- `days_remaining` uses IST today. Join still matches symbol then company name; non-constituents stay out
- Sensex tiles use company name. Weight colours match the stated buckets (3%+ high, 1–3% medium, &lt;1% low)

## V6.30 — 2026-08-15

Every index chip always shows last price and change; fewer duplicate quote calls.

- `/tickers` fills SENSEX/BANKNIFTY from last OI snapshot when Kite LTP is missing or zero (NIFTY selected no longer blanks the other chips)
- Quote lookup matches Kite keys with or without the `BSE:` prefix. Snapshots store prev_close / day_open
- One Dashboard `/tickers` fetch is shared with the header and phone ticker (no triple request). Tickers load immediately, including weekend. Spot WS still uses last snapshots (no extra Kite)

## V6.29 — 2026-08-15

Stop last-session OI toasts when NSE is closed; keep info tiles and tabs stable.

- Alerts toast only while NSE cash/F&O is open (`is_market_open`). Closed / weekend last-session change no longer pops toasts
- Next holiday and next event open an in-place dropdown (do not jump to Positions or the first dashboard tab)
- FII/DII and impact tiles fetch as soon as they are on screen, not only after a click
- Straddle and other tabs no longer blank the whole desk (removed page-level lazy Suspense; boot splash uses the desk background)
- Expiry picker uses the last snapshot when the Kite dump is not loaded
- MCX majors are paused: hidden from Index management / settings ticks, stripped from the poll list, Enable rejected

## V6.28 — 2026-08-15

Keep the desk as it was; only Index-management dump stays off auto-preload.

- Info tiles and desktop right panel default on again. VIX/GIFT, tickers, and alerts return shortly after first paint
- Open-index OI, chip-switch OI, FII/DII/impact on tile open, Positions-on-tab stay
- `/expiries` and tracker start no longer call `kite.instruments()`. Search/Sync in Index management still loads names when you ask

## V6.27 — 2026-08-15

Stop kicking users out when the origin is slow; slim the first JS load.

- Cloudflare 520/524/timeout on `/auth/state` no longer treats you as logged out. Session tokens stay; Retry if the desk is busy
- 401 on OI/positions does not wipe the login. Positions/journal/straddle load as separate chunks when you open them
- Dropped unused React Query wrapper and StrictMode double-mount. Auth/state no longer refreshes alert indices on every poll

## V6.26 — 2026-08-15

Stop auto-preload. Load F&O names and extra desk data when you ask for them.

- No Kite F&O dump after token save or tracker start. Index management **Search** or **Sync** fills the name list
- Dashboard only fetches the **open** index OI. Other indices load when you switch to them
- Positions, FII/DII, impact events, Desk AI, VIX/GIFT, tickers wait until that panel is open or well after first paint (was a 520 stampede)

## V6.25 — 2026-08-15

Paint the desk first, then fill data step by step.

- Open-index OI loads immediately (no wait on expiry list). Other indices, VIX/GIFT, tickers, alerts, Today P&L, and sidebar note follow with short delays
- Dropped duplicate boot calls: prefetch-all expiries, second OI fetch when the expiry picker catches up, stacked `/auth/state` on mount
- Re-checked V6.24 origin cuts: token save still background-only, `/expiries` still no Kite dump, `/ws/spot` still snapshot-only, PostHog still gone

## V6.24 — 2026-08-15

Cut origin load after Kite login; drop PostHog; sequential OI warm-cache.

- `sc.ecombullet.com/api/dashboard/totalusers` is **not** this app (other tab / extension / Emergent). Production Axios 520/524 on `aaisnamkeen.com/api/...` **is** this desk behind Cloudflare when origin is slow
- Publisher token save no longer dumps Kite instruments or polls on that request — F&O dump + expiry seed run in the background
- `GET /expiries/{index}` no longer reloads the full instrument dump; `/ws/spot` uses last OI snapshot (no per-second Kite LTP)
- Dashboard fetches the open index first; other names one-at-a-time and skip if cached < ~3 minutes. Overnight brief biases are sequential too
- Removed PostHog snippet + CSP hosts (session recording was extra browser/network load)

## V6.23 — 2026-08-15

Fix desk crash: `INDEX_STEP is not defined`.

- Restore Sidebar imports (`INDEX_STEP`, `INDEX_SHORT`, `usesIndexOverflow`) and TickerStrip `INDEX_CHIP_CAP` dropped in V6.21

## V6.22 — 2026-08-15

F&O Index-management dump loads itself after every publisher token.

- Saving a Kite access token (credentials / daily login) reloads instruments and writes `kite_underlyings` in the background — no manual `preload_fno.py`
- Same cache refresh on tracker start and the first IST poll of the day. The CLI remains optional for ops

## V6.21 — 2026-08-15

Gold/MCX quotes stay on that name; Enable is one click; Analyze blue/green.

- Selecting GOLD no longer paints NIFTY’s print on the GOLD chip/sidebar. Live ticker and Kite LTP win; OI snapshot price is used only when `current.index` matches
- Spot websocket quotes every enabled name in its own session hours (nearest MCX FUT) instead of a full NIFTY chain poll
- Index management: Enable / Disable on the row (no Inspect gate). Daily `backend/preload_fno.py` refreshes the Kite F&O dump
- Journal / position heatmap: GOLD / CRUDE / SILVER / NG get named rows when booked; Others stays for FINNIFTY and stocks
- Desk AI Gold news follows the selected commodity even if the enabled-list check lagged
- Header ticker scrollbar hidden; drag / mouse to slide. Analyze close on the right; now-curve blue, expiry green

## V6.20 — 2026-08-15

Enable extras end-to-end, Desk AI per selected MCX name, Analyze emerald chrome.

- Index management Enable: 90s timeout, FastAPI error text (not a blank “Enable failed”), session_group on the registry row. Kite MCX CE/PE labelled `MCX` (not `MCX-OPT`) still load the chain
- Admin configuration tracked-index ticks include extras already on; saving no longer drops GOLD
- Header / sidebar / phone picker still use `INDEX_CHIP_CAP` = 3; enabled names appear there after Enable
- Desk AI: `GET /desk-outside?index=` — Gold selected → Gold news/fut; NIFTY selected → existing cash heavyweight tape
- Analyze tabs, header, now-curve: emerald like Journal (put/call OI bars stay green/red)

## V6.19 — 2026-08-15

Extra indices fit the existing phone and desktop chrome. Checklist requires phone in the same PR.

- Phone index row stays a 3-slot grid. Four or more names (Gold, Crude, …) use a dropdown in those slots plus the active quote chip — header and sidebar width/height unchanged
- Header still slides; sidebar still drops down after three chips (`INDEX_CHIP_CAP`)
- Live ticker on the phone includes every enabled name. Index management stays the same dialog size (scroll inside)
- DEVELOPMENT.md: phone + do not grow header/sidebar, for every new index and every new desk UI

## V6.18 — 2026-08-15

Index management works on the phone.

- Admin Settings (gear) on phone and tablet now has **Index management** next to Admin configuration — same search / inspect / enable as desktop
- The add-index sheet is full-screen on small screens with larger tap targets. Discover more from Admin configuration closes that modal first so the sheet is usable

## V6.17 — 2026-08-15

Journal Others, per-commodity poll hours, and a ship-to-main checklist.

- Positions still lists every Kite net/day leg (Gold, Crude, FINNIFTY, stocks). Those books land in the admin journal; the year heatmap always has an **Others** row
- Each catalog name has a `session_group`. NSE stops polling at 15:40; MCX non-agri (GOLD, SILVER, CRUDEOIL, NATURALGAS) polls 09:00–23:30 IST in US DST and until 23:55 otherwise. Select agri 21:00 / other agri 17:00 when those names are added
- Journal freeze waits for the latest enabled close + 5 minutes so evening commodity exits are not dropped
- Checklist in DEVELOPMENT.md: hours, poll, Positions, journal Others, tests, **merge to main**

## V6.16 — 2026-08-15

Kite login link works again. Extra indices do not crowd the sidebar or header.

- Credentials modal: `safeHttpUrl` was missing — “Could not open Kite login” on the request_token link. Login is a real link when the key is vaulted
- Sidebar: three indices stay as chips; more than three uses a dropdown so expiry / ATM layout does not shift
- Header tickers: more than three slide horizontally (drag / scroll), slightly tighter tiles

## V6.15 — 2026-08-15

MCX majors can sit on the OI desk. Kite names are CRUDEOIL, GOLD, SILVER, NATURALGAS (not the minis).

- ATM / header LTP from the **nearest MCX FUT** (rolls; Gold tender drops the front month)
- When a commodity is enabled, OI polls **09:00–23:30 IST** on NSE trading days. Cash indices still close 15:40
- Admin → Index management: Crude / Gold / Silver / Nat. gas shortcuts. Enable is opt-in — default board stays NIFTY / SENSEX / BANKNIFTY
- Publisher Kite needs the commodity segment. Same `get_snapshot` pipeline as the three desk indices

## V6.14 — 2026-08-15

Index Risk is a normal dashboard page again. Admin configuration compiles.

- Index Risk uses the same Public / Admin ticks as OI Change, Straddle, Positions, and the rest (header Public menu still has a shortcut)
- The Index Risk tab always shows summary cards and an empty state when there are no upcoming events (it no longer paints a blank board)
- Admin configuration: restored Alert focus indices JSX (`SettingsModal` parse error on `</section>`)

## V6.13 — 2026-08-15

Analyze chart uses desk colours. Admin can discover and enable more Kite F&O names without a code change.

- Payoff chart: Put `#16A34A`, Call `#DC2626`, now-curve sky-600, expiry slate — same language as OI Change
- `index_registry` bootstraps NIFTY / SENSEX / BANKNIFTY. Admin → Index management searches the Kite dump, inspects CE/PE/OI, enable/disable (history kept)
- Enabled names share the existing OI poller / OI Change / straddle / strike table pipeline
- MCX still only polls during NSE cash hours until a commodity session clock exists

## V6.12 — 2026-08-15

Instrument universe + engineering docs. Live OI board unchanged (NIFTY / SENSEX / BANKNIFTY).

- One catalog (`backend/universe.py`, `frontend/src/lib/universe.js`) so a later market is not another copy-paste of three names
- Crude / Gold / Silver / Natural gas are **catalogued, not polled** (Kite MCX has OI; hours and futures-spot are not wired)
- `/config` adds `universe`. Settings still only tick the three desk indices
- Docs: ENGINEERING_RULES, ARCHITECTURE, DEVELOPMENT, AI_DEVELOPMENT_RULES, ADR-001. Env examples committed

## V6.11 — 2026-08-15

Book Analyze is a payoff studio, not a sparse card.

- Full-screen Analyze: index + spot %, Live P&L, **Add booked P&L**, Chart / Legs on phone
- Payoff chart with current-price and projected-P&L pills, now vs expiry curves, Call/Put OI at ATM, ±1/2 SD
- Legs read like a book: B/S badges, `qty × expiry strike CE/PE`, checkbox, Total footer
- Payoff table plus compact target and date sliders; tap the chart to set the target

## V6.10 — 2026-08-15

Journal holiday names, Book radar copy, overnight tile, Telegram session wrap, Kite login errors, phone sidebar.

- Journal phone cells show the real holiday name (not “Holi”). Muhurat stays Muhurat even on a weekend listing
- Book radar no longer asks to upload constituents when they are already on file
- Overnight risk tile matches the other insight tiles. “Carry shorts” is now **Hold overnight?** / **Overnight**
- Phone sidebar starts below the header so OI Pulse and the version stay visible
- Telegram: readable huge-OI notes; session wrap at **15:15 IST** with next-session calendar. Never the book
- Kite token: paste the whole login URL; checksum vs already-used tokens get a plain-language error
- First OI load paints the open index before the other two

## V6.09 — 2026-08-14

Journal next-month crash, year heatmap index rows, phone brand.

- Opening a month that has an NSE holiday no longer blanks the desk (`object && true` was calling `.replace` on a missing holiday name)
- Year heatmap attributes booked P&L from the option symbol when a stored leg has no `index` (Thursday SENSEX ~21k lands on SENSEX, not only the month total)
- Phone header always shows **OI Pulse** and the version next to the live clock

## V6.08 — 2026-08-14

Journal books partial closes, not only fully squared legs.

- Closing 3 of 13 lots is realised P&L on Kite even while quantity stays open. The journal now stores that `realised` with full exits
- Calendar / heatmap use that booked total (the 8.4k-vs-21k gap was full-exit-only)
- Positions “Profit booked today” uses the same `pnl_today.booked` figure

## V6.07 — 2026-08-14

Muhurat is a live trading session for charts and OI, not a holiday.

- Diwali Laxmi Pujan Muhurat polls Open Interest during the NSE special window (2025: 13:30–14:45 IST)
- Kite has no exchange-open API; a fresh NIFTY/SENSEX last_trade_time also starts polling if the tape is printing
- Journal EOD lock follows that session’s close + 5 minutes. Full holidays stay closed

## V6.06 — 2026-08-14

Journal books weekends and full holidays as closed, and treats live special sessions as trading days.

- Weekends and full NSE holidays (Republic Day, Holi, Balipratipada, …) do not get a new journal date; last session stays until the next open
- Diwali Laxmi Pujan **Muhurat** is a journal session (calendar shows Muhurat, EOD lock 20:00 IST). OI poll still treats it as a holiday
- If Kite prints fills or index last-trade on a closed calendar day, that day is booked as a live session

## V6.05 — 2026-08-14

Journal weekends are not trading days. Carry Desk AI is overnight impact only.

- Positions poll no longer writes Saturday/Sunday (or holiday) journal rows. Friday stays until the next session
- Auto weekend/holiday journal docs are purged; calendar and weekly recap ignore them
- Carry brief **Desk AI** toggle stays; the box only lists next-session impact (heavyweights that can gap the index, HIGH events, relevant news) — not the full WHAT/WHY/BUYER dump

## V6.04 — 2026-08-14

Carry brief, Desk AI, and Radar no longer share one coach dump. Radar tiles move up/down.

- Carry brief has its own **AI** toggle (desktop). Off on phones for now. Coach is overnight-only (why carry / VIX / GIFT), not the cash tape
- Desk AI panel stays heavyweights + news; Radar stays book risk vs cash
- Radar intel tiles: up/down arrows (and drag) with a separate saved order

## V6.03 — 2026-08-14

Desk AI is one on/off for the whole desk. Phone opens a popup; desktop keeps the side panel.

- Header AI: one switch + Open in side panel (Ask AI / slim strip / Jump to strip removed)
- Guests can turn it on the same as admin (`POST /desk-ai`)
- Phone: AI chip opens a full-tape popup; close returns to the chart (no strip on the grid)
- Desk AI removed from Admin configuration (renamed from Alert settings)

## V6.02 — 2026-08-14

Desk AI is off until you turn it on. The tape is readable tiles, Radar-only on Positions, and the phone header no longer overflows.

- Alert Settings: Show Desk AI, Ask AI, Book radar intelligence
- Header AI chip still flips the same Show/Ask on the desk (icon-only on phone)
- Intelligence is one sentence + swapable tiles (heavyweights, breadth, news, calendar, what to do)
- Positions book has no AI strip — Radar has the tick, resizable
- Phone header: compact clock, icon AI chip, Today P&L off that row

## V6.01 — 2026-08-14

Desk AI no longer eats the OI grid. Config works on the phone.

- Chart keeps a **collapsed one-line strip** (More + drag to resize). Full tape is a **Desk AI** view in the right panel
- Header **AI** chip is on phone and desktop: Show / Ask / slim-strip-on-chart
- Tiles and OI chart stay the main surface

## V6.00 — 2026-08-14

Market intelligence desk: what OI alone cannot see (heavyweights, breadth, news, event risk).

- Uses the **same constituent files** already uploaded under Impact Risk / Admin → Upload (weightage included)
- Kite last prices; Yahoo fallback. OpenAI key still optional, server env only
- Header **AI** chip: Show Desk AI + Ask AI for admin **and** guests together (not Alert Settings)
- Positions toolbar **AI** tick; Radar panel **AI** tick (on when you turn Desk AI on)
- Coach format: WHAT / WHY / OPTION BUYER / OPTION SELLER / WATCH NEXT

## V5.19 — 2026-08-14

Desk AI is **outside the OI chart**: heavyweight cash movers + news, not a PCR recap.

- Quotes top-weight Nifty / Bank / Sensex names (uploaded constituents) via Kite or Yahoo
- Pulls market headlines (public RSS)
- Coach tells you which heavyweight is dragging the index and what that means for sold CE vs PE

## V5.18 — 2026-08-14

Desk AI reads the live OI tape (not just yesterday’s FII print). Admin ticks who sees the bar.

- Coach uses PCR, CE/PE OI change, walls, VIX, GIFT, shorts, calendar; FII/DII labelled T+1
- Rules rewrite every tick; GPT only on Ask AI / ~5 min cache
- Alert Settings: **Desk AI (Admin)** / **Desk AI (Public)**

## V5.17 — 2026-08-14

Phone Positions: Live / Exited toggles actually show the book; Columns menu is a portaled sheet.

- Mobile was never rendering exited cards after the Exited chip
- Duplicate Live/Exited blocks on phone could swallow the same tap (toggle twice = stays closed)
- Columns no longer clip inside the toolbar — fixed sheet above the phone dock; outside-tap guard so iOS does not close it on the opening tap

## V5.16 — 2026-08-14

Publish/readiness: `/health` `/ready` `/api/health` bind before Mongo/Kite boot. Chrome events extension left this repo.

- Startup schedules `_boot()` in the background so Emergent/k8s probes get 200 as soon as uvicorn listens
- Market Events Chrome extension lives in **https://github.com/adeotale27/Market_Events** (no Kite, no OI Pulse poller)

## V5.15 — 2026-08-14

Desk AI is a first-class strip (not a hidden LLM footnote). Independent Chrome radar for holidays / FII-DII / VIX / results.

- **Desk AI** bar under the header + header **AI** chip; Ask AI bypasses the 5-minute cache
- Positions and carry brief use the same violet AI treatment
- Snapshot can include cash FII/DII nets (clipped)
- Domain shortlist: [`docs/DOMAINS.md`](docs/DOMAINS.md)
- Chrome radar was added here then **moved** to https://github.com/adeotale27/Market_Events in V5.16

## V5.14 — 2026-08-14

Positions desk coach (roll / hedge / hold) plus a publish-safe desk-guide model.

- Positions shows a **Desk coach** strip: which shorts are too close or ITM, and when net Δ needs flattening
- `POST /api/desk-guide` caches **carry** and **positions** separately; `DeskGuideIn` uses `Field(default_factory=list)` so FastAPI 0.110 / Pydantic 2 can import
- Optional LLM still every ~5 minutes when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set — alerts unchanged

## V5.13 — 2026-08-14

Carry brief is a movable case file (why / why-not / results) plus an optional AI pass.

- Open the brief for **Why carry** vs **Why not**, session OI vs your shorts, and wrapping result/holiday rows (not a 3-line dump)
- Drag it horizontally anywhere on desktop, or snap left / center / right
- Optional LLM: `POST /api/desk-guide` every ~5 minutes when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set — see [docs/AI.md](docs/AI.md). Alerts are unchanged

## V5.12 — 2026-08-13

Carry brief matches the mint card (no black bar) and fits on a phone without inner scroll.

- Header uses the same green/amber/rose panel as the body
- Phone: one-line index rows, short event names, no nested scrolling

## V5.11 — 2026-08-13


Positions Charges / Privacy tiles match Radar and Journal; carry brief parse error gone.

- Charges and Privacy are the same height as Radar / Journal, with near-black labels (no more washed-out grey)
- OvernightGapBrief declares dock classes once so the frontend builds

## V5.10 — 2026-08-13


Carry brief stays usable on phone and talks like an options seller.

- Phone: moon chip by default; the sheet stays on the dock (no more blank overlay dragged over OI Change / Positions)
- Dark header + a floating Close control; swipe down on the handle to minimize
- Copy is about carrying **short premium**: session OI (which shorts are supported), GIFT, India VIX, holidays, and heavy index-impact only

## V5.09 — 2026-08-13


Journal save actually persists notes; carry brief docks left and can be closed on phone.

- Save journal ignored the click (the mouse event was treated as the day document) — notes, tags, and score now PUT and reload
- Carry brief defaults to the left on desktop; drag the header or use the dock control to move it
- Phone carry brief is height-capped with large Minimize / Close controls so it cannot trap the screen
- Dialogs sit above the carry chip so Save and other modal actions stay clickable

## V5.08 — 2026-08-13

Journal year grid stays in lockstep with the open month; Straddle WS is quiet in production.

- Year heatmap overlays the calendar’s booked month (so today’s book cannot vanish on the year tab)
- Saving a journal day reloads the year recap
- Straddle WebSocket connect/reconnect logs only in development

## V5.07 — 2026-08-13

Production hardening and leftover desk polish. Alerts are unchanged.

- Phone quotes stay fresh (ticker LTP, not a one-shot seed); one `/tickers` poll shared with the marquee
- Heatmap tap jumps to the visible position card on phone
- Sidebar dimmer sits above the dock; Kite login URLs must be http(s)
- Journal screenshots require real image bytes; login rate limits; CSP / no-store API
- Desk error boundary so a UI throw does not blank the board

## V5.06 — 2026-08-13

Production polish: mobile quotes, side drawer, journal focus, heatmap, load.

- Phone index tiles show LTP, points, and today’s % for NIFTY / SENSEX / BANKNIFTY (no “tap”, ATM, or last-session row)
- Sidebar opens from the left again (not a bottom sheet)
- Right panel dropdown includes **OI Change** (delta bars)
- Position heatmap is the **open** book of the **active index**, with strike CE/PE labels — closed SENSEX legs no longer linger
- Journal: tap a day and the calendar / weekly recap step aside; the date chip sits under the month title with notes on the right; tap the chip to restore the month
- Year heatmap actually loads (and falls back to the current month if the year payload is empty)
- Spot ticks merge instead of replacing other indices

## V5.05 — 2026-08-13

Trade journal calendar is readable on phone.

- Compact 7-day grid (date + booked P&L only) instead of overflowing desktop cards
- Month booked strip + weekly recap on phone; tap a day for full notes / charges
- Year heatmap on phone is a month list (booked by index), not a squeezed table
- Calendar figures stay booked/exited P&L (never open MTM)

## V5.04 — 2026-08-13

Desk polish: About notes split by role, mobile dock/sidebar, carry brief, straddle.

- Logo / version About: guests see UI and desk behaviour only; admin also sees APIs, k8s, Mongo
- Phone dock labels match dashboard tabs (OI Change, Index Risk, Strike Table); clearer icons; Pages picker
- Mobile sidebar is a curved sheet — tap the dimmed area to close
- Open Interest on phone includes strikes above & below ATM
- Index bar uses three tiles plus ATM / expiry instead of one empty dropdown
- Straddle chart on phone is shorter, no overlapping legend
- Carry brief from 14:00 IST through next open; slide to the right edge for moon-only

## V5.03 — 2026-08-13

Index Risk, journal after-charges, and heatmaps now use booked (exited) data only.

- Admin **Last successful upload** / Index Event Risk only appears when there are upcoming events or a stale/missing CSV
- Journal **after charges** uses Kite contract-note totals when present; no longer treats missing charges as ₹0 (so booked equals after-charges)
- Year heatmap, calendar, and position heatmap ignore open NIFTY MTM — only exited P&L is stored and shown

## V5.02 — 2026-08-13

Backend crashed on import (nginx `connection refused` to :8001, k8s never Ready).

FastAPI 0.110 treats `GET /positions(request: Optional[Request] = None)` as a Pydantic
response field. Signature is now `request: Request` like the other desk routes.
Removing unused Emergent pip packages did not cause this — the traceback is this route.

## V5.01 — 2026-08-13

K8s publish was timing out at readiness (build OK, pod never Ready).

- Stop blocking boot on Kite `instruments()` dump, `profile()`, and Yahoo VIX/GIFT fetches
- `/health`, `/ready`, `/api/health` return 200 as soon as uvicorn listens
- Slim `requirements.txt`: drop unused stripe, emergentintegrations, pytest, twisted/autobahn pins, APScheduler, JWT/passlib, aiohttp
- Lazy-import pandas (event uploads only) so the API process is not huge at start

## V5.00 — 2026-08-13

Baseline of the live NSE OI desk.

- NIFTY / SENSEX / BANKNIFTY open-interest polling via publisher Kite token
- Admin vs guest desks with independent **Public / Admin** page ticks
- Guest Connect Zerodha for their own positions (charts stay on publisher OI)
- Trade journal (admin) with booked P&L stored in Mongo
- Alerts, huge-shift popups, Index Risk, CAS expiry, straddles, sell candidates
- In-app **About** on logo / version click
- Product README + versioning so new AI/sessions start from **V5**
- Publish fix: drop broken Emergent visual-edits tarball; CRA build no longer treats warnings as errors
